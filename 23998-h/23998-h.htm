<h2><i>Travel and Adventure</i></h2>

<h4>SIR SAMUEL BAKER</h4>

<h4>The Albert N'yanza</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Explorations of the Nile
Source</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sir Samuel White Baker was born in London, on June 8, 1821. From
early manhood he devoted himself to a life of adventure. After a
year in Mauritius he founded a colony in the mountains of Ceylon at
Newera Eliya, and later constructed the railway across the
Dobrudsha. His discovery of the Albert N'yanza completed the
labours of Speke and Grant, and solved the mystery of the Nile.
Baker's administration of the Soudan was the first great effort to
arrest the slave trade in the Nile Basin, and also the first step
towards the establishment of the British Protectorate of Uganda and
Somaliland. Baker died on December 30, 1893. He was a voluminous
writer, and his books had immense popularity. "The Albert N'yanza"
may be regarded as the most important of his works of travel by
reason of the exploration which it records rather than on account
of any exceptional literary merit. Here his story is one of such
thrilling interest that even a dull writer could scarce have failed
to hold the attention of any reader by its straightforward
narration.</p>
</div>

<p>In March, 1861, I commenced an expedition to discover the
sources of the Nile, with the hope of meeting the East African
Expedition of Captains Speke and Grant that had been sent by the
English Government from the south, via Zanzibar, for that object.
From my youth I had been inured to hardships and endurance in wild
sports in tropical climates; and when I gazed upon the map of
Africa I had the hope that I might, by perseverance, reach the
heart of Africa. Had I been alone it would have been no hard lot to
die upon the untrodden path before me; but my wife resolved, with
woman's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span> constancy, to leave the luxuries of home and share
all danger, and to follow me through each rough step in the wild
life in which I was about to engage. Thus accompanied, on April 15,
1861, I sailed up the Nile from Cairo to Korosko; and thence, by a
forced camel march across the Nubian desert, we reached the river
of Abou Hamed, and, still on camels, though within view of the
palm-trees that bordered the Nile, we came to Berber. I spent a
year in learning Arabic, and while doing so explored the Atbara,
which joins the Nile twenty miles south of Berber, and the Blue
Nile, which joins the main stream at Khartoum, with all their
affluents from the mountains of Abyssinia. The general result of
these explorations was that I found that the waters of the Atbara
when in flood are dense with soil washed from the fertile lands
scoured by its tributaries after the melting of the snows and the
rainy season; and these, joining with the Blue Nile in full flood,
also charged with a red earthy matter, cause the annual inundation
in Lower Egypt, the sediment from which gives to that country its
remarkable fertility.</p>

<p>I reached Khartoum, the capital of the Soudan, on June 11, 1862.
Moosa Pasha was at that time governor-general. He was a rather
exaggerated specimen of Turkish authority, combining the worst of
oriental failings with the brutality of the wild animal. At that
time the Soudan was of little commercial importance to Egypt. What
prompted the occupation of the country by the Egyptians was that
the Soudan supplied slaves not only for Egypt, but for Arabia and
Persia.</p>

<p>In the face of determined opposition of Moosa Pasha and the Nile
traders, who were persuaded that my object in penetrating into
unknown Central Africa was to put a stop to the nefarious slave
traffic, I organised my expedition. It consisted of three
vessels&mdash;a good decked diahbiah (for my wife, and myself and
our personal attendants), and two noggurs, or
sailing-barges&mdash;the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> to take stores, twenty-one
donkeys, four camels and four horses. Forty-five armed men as
escort, and forty sailors, all in brown uniform, with
servants&mdash;ninety-six men in all&mdash;constituted my
personnel.</p>

<p>On February 2, 1863, we reached Gondokoro, where I landed my
animals and stores. It is a curious circumstance that, although
many Europeans had been as far south as Gondokoro, I was the first
Englishman who had ever reached it. Gondokoro I found a perfect
hell. There were about 600 slave-hunters and ivory-traders and
their people, who passed the whole of their time in drinking,
quarrelling and ill-treating the slaves, of which the camps were
full; and the natives assured me that there were large depots of
slaves in the interior who would be marched to Gondokoro for
shipment to the Soudan a few hours after my departure.</p>

<p>I had heard rumours of Speke and Grant, and determined to wait
for a time before proceeding forward. Before very long there was a
mutiny among my men, who wanted to make a "razzia" upon the cattle
of the natives, which, of course, I prohibited. It had been
instigated by the traders, who were determined, if possible, to
stop my advance. With the heroic assistance of my wife, I quelled
the revolt. On February 15, on the rattle of musketry at a great
distance, my men rushed madly to my boat with the report that two
white men, who had come from the sea, had arrived. Could they be
Speke and Grant? Off I ran, and soon met them in reality; and, with
a heart beating with joy, I took off my cap and gave a welcome
hurrah! We were shortly seated on the deck of my diahbiah under the
awning; and such rough fare as could be hastily prepared was set
before these two ragged, careworn specimens of African travel. At
the first blush of meeting them I considered my expedition as
terminated, since they had discovered the Nile source; but upon my
congratulating them with all my heart upon the honours they had so
nobly earned,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span> Speke and Grant, with characteristic generosity, gave
me a map of their route, showing that they had been unable to
complete the actual exploration of the Nile, and that the most
important portion still remained to be determined. It appeared that
in N. lat. 2&deg; 17' they had crossed the Nile, which they had
tracked from the Victoria Lake; but the river, which from its exit
from that lake had a northern course, turned suddenly to the west
from Karuma Falls (the point at which they crossed it at lat.
2&deg; 17'). They did not see the Nile again until they arrived in
N. lat. 3&deg; 32', which was then flowing from the W.S.W. The
natives and the King of Unyoro (Kamrasi) had assured them that the
Nile from the Victoria N'yanza, which they had crossed at Karuma,
flowed westward for several days' journey, and at length fell into
a large lake called the Luta N'zige; that this lake came from the
south, and that the Nile, on entering the northern extremity,
almost immediately made its exit, and, as a navigable river,
continued its course to the north, through the Koshi and Madi
countries. Both Speke and Grant attached great importance to this
lake Luta N'zige; and the former was much annoyed that it had been
impossible for them to carry out the exploration.</p>

<p>I now heard that the field was not only open, but that an
additional interest was given to the exploration by the proof that
the Nile flowed out of one great lake, the Victoria, but that it
evidently must derive an additional supply from an unknown lake as
it entered it at the northern extremity, while the body of the lake
came from the south. The fact of a great body of water, such as the
Luta N'zige, extending in a direct line from south to north, while
the general system of drainage of the Nile was from the same
direction, showed most conclusively that the Luta N'zige, if it
existed in the form assumed, must have an important position in the
basin of the Nile. I determined, therefore, to go on. Speke<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span> and
Grant, who were naturally anxious to reach England as soon as
possible, sailed in my boat, on February 26, from Gondokoro for
Khartoum. Our hearts were much too full to say more than a short
"God bless you!" They had won their victory; my work lay all before
me.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Perils of Darkest Africa</i></div>

<p>My plan was to follow a party of traders known by the name of
"Turks," and led by an Arab named Ibrahim, which was going to the
Latooka country to trade for ivory and slaves, trusting to
Providence, good fortune, and the virtue of presents. That party
set out early in the afternoon of March 26, 1863. I had secured
some rather unwilling men as drivers and porters, and was
accompanied by two trusty followers, Richarn and a boy Saat, both
of whom had been brought up in the Austrian mission in Khartoum. We
had neither guide nor interpreter; but when the moon rose, knowing
that the route lay on the east side of the mountain of Belignan, I
led the way on my horse Filfil, Mrs. Baker riding by my side on my
old Abyssinian hunter, T&eacute;tel, and the British flag following
behind us as a guide for the caravan of heavily laden camels and
donkeys. We pushed on over rough country intersected by ravines
till we came to the valley of Tollogo, bounded with perpendicular
walls of grey granite, one thousand feet in height, the natives of
which were much excited at the sight of the horses and the camels,
which were to them unknown animals. After passing through this
defile, Ibrahim and his "Turks," whom we had passed during the
previous night, overtook us. These slave-hunters and ivory-traders
threatened effectually to spoil our enterprise, if not to secure
the murder of Mrs. Baker, myself and my entire party, by raising
the suspicion and enmity of the native tribes. We afterwards found
that there had been a conspiracy to do this. We thought it best,
therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span> to parley with Ibrahim, and came to terms with him by
means of bribes of a double-barrelled gun and some gold.</p>

<p>Under his auspices our joint caravan cleared the palisaded
villages of Ellyria, after paying blackmail to the chief,
Legg&eacute;, whose villainous countenance was stamped with
ferocity, avarice and sensuality. Glad to escape from this country,
we crossed the Kan&#299;&#275;ti river, a tributary of the Sobat,
itself a tributary of the White Nile, and entered the country of
Latooka, which is bounded by the Lafeet chain of mountains. In the
forests and on the plain were countless elephants, giraffes,
buffaloes, rhinoceroses, and varieties of large antelopes, together
with winged game. The natives are the finest savages I have ever
seen, their average height being five feet eleven and a half
inches, and their facial features remarkably pleasing. We stayed on
many weeks at Tarrangoll&eacute;, the capital, which is completely
surrounded by palisaded walls, within which are over three thousand
houses, each a little fort in itself, and kraals for twelve
thousand head of cattle. In the neighbourhood I had some splendid
big-game shooting; but we had difficulties with repeated mutinies
of our men.</p>

<p>Early in May we left Latooka, and crossed a high mountain chain
by a pass 2,500 feet in height into the beautiful country of Obbo.
This is a fertile plateau, 3,674 feet above sea-level, with
abundance of wild grapes and other fruits, yams, nuts, flax,
tobacco, etc.; but the travelling was difficult owing to the high
grass. The people are pleasant-featured and good-natured, and the
chief, Katchiba, maintains his authority by a species of
hocus-pocus, or sorcery. He is a merry soul, has a multiplicity of
wives&mdash;a bevy in each village&mdash;so that when he travels
through his kingdom he is always at home. His children number 116,
and the government is quite a family affair, for he has one of his
sons as chief in every village. A native of Obbo showed me some
cowrie-shells which he said came from a country called<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span> Magungo,
situated on a lake so large that no one knew its limits. This lake,
said I, can be no other than Luta N'zige which Speke had heard of,
and I shall take the first opportunity to push for Magungo.</p>

<p>We returned to Latooka to pick up our stores and rejoin Ibrahim,
but were detained by the illness of Mrs. Baker and myself and the
loss of some of my transport animals. The joint caravan left
Latooka on June 23 for Unyoro, Mrs. Baker in an improvised
palanquin. The weather was wretched. Constant rains made progress
slow; and the natives of the districts through which we passed were
dying like flies from smallpox. When we at last reached Obbo we
could proceed no further.</p>

<p>My wife and I were so ill with bilious fever that we could not
assist each other; my horses, camels and donkeys all died. Flies by
day, rats and innumerable bugs by night in the miserable hut where
we were located, lions roaring through the dark, never-ending
rains, made for many weary months of Obbo a prison about as
disagreeable as could be imagined. Having purchased some oxen in
lieu of horses and baggage animals, we at length were able to leave
Obbo on January 5, 1864, passing through Far&#257;joke, crossing the
river Asua at an altitude of 2,875 feet above sea-level, and then
on to Fatiko, the capital of the Shooa country, at an altitude of
3,877 feet.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Discovery of the Nile's
Sources</i></div>

<p>Shooa proved a land flowing with milk and honey. Provisions of
every kind were abundant and cheap. The pure air invigorated Mrs.
Baker and myself; and on January 18 we left Shooa for Unyoro,
Kamrasi's country. On the 22nd we struck the Somerset River, or the
Victoria White Nile, and crossed it at the Karuma Falls, marching
thence to M'rooli, Kamrasi's capital, at the junction of the Kafoor
River with the Somerset, which<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span> was reached on February 10.
Here we were detained till February 21, with exasperating excuses
for preventing us going further, and audacious demands from Kamrasi
for everything that I had, including my last watch and my wife! We
were surrounded by a great number of natives, and, as my suspicions
of treachery appeared confirmed, I drew my revolver, resolved that
if this was to be the end of the expedition it should also be the
end of Kamrasi. I held the revolver within two feet of his chest,
looked at him with undisguised contempt, and told him that if he
dared to repeat the insult I would shoot him on the spot. My wife
also made him a speech in Arabic (not a word of which he
understood), with a countenance as amiable as the head of a Medusa.
Altogether, the <i>mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> utterly astonished him,
and he let us go, furnishing us with a guide named Rabongo to take
us to M'wootan N'zige, not Luta N'zige, as Speke had erroneously
suggested. In crossing the Kafoor River on a bridge of floating
weeds, Mrs. Baker had a sunstroke, fell through the weeds into deep
water, and was rescued with great difficulty. For many days she
remained in a deep torpor, and was carried on a litter while we
marched through an awful broken country. The torpor was followed by
brain fever, with its attendant horrors. The rain poured in
torrents; and day after day we were forced to travel for want of
provisions, as in the deserted villages there were no supplies.
Sometimes in the forest we procured wild honey, and rarely I was
able to shoot a few guinea-fowl. We reached a village one night
following a day on which my wife had had violent convulsions. I
laid her down on a litter within a hut, covered her with a Scotch
plaid, and I fell upon my mat insensible, worn out with sorrow and
fatigue. When I woke the next morning I found my wife breathing
gently, the fever gone, the eyes calm. She was saved! The gratitude
of that moment I will not attempt to describe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>On March 14 the day broke beautifully clear; and, having crossed
a deep valley between the hills, we toiled op the opposite slope. I
hurried to the summit. The glory of our prize burst suddenly upon
me! There, like a sea of quicksilver, lay, far beneath, the grand
expanse of water, a boundless sea horizon on the south and
south-west, glittering in the noon-day sun; and on the west, fifty
or sixty miles distant, blue mountains rose from the bosom of the
lake to a height of 7,000 feet above its level. It is impossible to
describe the triumph of that moment. Here was the reward for all
our labour&mdash;for the years of tenacity with which we had toiled
through Africa. England had won the sources of the Nile!</p>

<p>I was about 1,500 feet above the lake; and I looked down from
the steep granite cliff upon those welcome waters, upon that vast
reservoir which nourished Egypt, and brought fertility where all
was wilderness, upon that great source so long hidden from mankind;
that source of bounty and of blessing to millions of human beings;
and, as one of the greatest objects in Nature, I determined to
honour it with a great name. As an imperishable memorial of one
loved and mourned by our gracious queen, and deplored by every
Englishman, I called this great lake "The Albert N'yanza." The
Victoria and the Albert Lakes are the two sources of the Nile.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Exploring the Great Lake</i></div>

<p>The zigzag path of the descent to the lake was so steep and
dangerous that we were forced to leave our oxen with a guide, who
was to take them to Magungo, and wait for our arrival. We commenced
the descent of the steep pass on foot. I led the way, grasping a
stout bamboo. My wife, in extreme weakness, tottered down the pass,
supporting herself on my shoulder, and stopping to rest every
twenty paces. After a toilsome descent of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span> about two hours,
weak with years of fever, but for the moment strengthened by
success, we gained the level plain below the cliff. A walk of about
a mile through flat sandy meadows of fine turf, interspersed with
trees and bush, brought us to the water's edge. The waves were
rolling upon a white pebbly beach. I rushed into the lake, and,
thirsty with fatigue, with a heart full of gratitude, I drank deep
from the sources of the Nile. Within a quarter of a mile of the
lake was a fishing village named Vacovia, in which we now
established ourselves.</p>

<p>At sunrise of the following morning I took the compass to the
borders of the lake to survey the country. It was beautifully
clear; and with a powerful telescope I could distinguish two large
waterfalls that cleft the sides of the mountains like threads of
silver. My wife, who had followed me so devotedly, stood by my side
pale and exhausted&mdash;a wreck upon the shores of the great
Albert Lake that we had so long striven to reach. No European foot
had ever trod upon its sand, nor had the eyes of a white man ever
scanned its vast expanse of water. We were the first; and this was
the key to the great secret that even Julius Caesar yearned to
unravel, but in vain!</p>

<p>Having procured two canoes, we started on a voyage of
exploration northward on the lake. Along the east coast, with
cliffs 1,500 feet in height, we discovered a waterfall of 1,000
feet drop, formed by the Kaiigiri River emptying itself in the
lake. On shore there were many elephants, and in the lake hundreds
of hippopotami and crocodiles. We made narrow escapes of shipwreck
on several occasions; and on the thirteenth day of our voyage the
lake contracted to between fifteen and twenty miles in width, but
the canoe came into a perfect wilderness of aquatic vegetation. On
the western shore was the kingdom of Malegga, and a chain of
mountains 4,000 feet high, but decreasing in height towards the
north. We reached the long-sought town of Magungo, and entered<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span> a channel, which we were informed was the
embouchure of the Somerset River, from the Victoria N'yanza, the
same river we had crossed at Karuma. Here we found our guide
Rabonga and the riding oxen. The town and general level of the
country was 500 feet above the water. A few miles to the north was
a gap in the Malegga range; due N. E. the country was a dead flat;
and as far as the eye could reach was an extent of bright green
reeds marking the course of the Nile as it made its exit out of the
lake. The natives refused most positively to take me down the Nile
outlet on account of their dread of the Madi people on its banks. I
determined, therefore, to go by canoe up the Somerset River, and
finally to fix the course of that stream as I had promised Speke to
do.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;Escape from Savage
Enemies</i></div>

<p>Both my wife and I were helpless with fever, and when we made
our first halt at a village I had to be carried ashore on a litter,
and my wife was so weak that she had to crawl on foot. At first the
river was 500 yards wide, but on the second day it narrowed to 250
yards. As we pulled up the stream, it narrowed to 180 yards, and,
rounding a corner, a magnificent sight burst suddenly upon us. On
each side were beautifully wooded cliffs rising abruptly to a
height of about 300 feet, and rushing through a gap which cleft the
rock exactly before us, the river, contracted from a grand stream,
was pent up in a narrow gorge of scarcely fifty yards in width.
Roaring furiously through the rock-bound pass, it plunged in one
leap of about 120 feet perpendicular into a dark abyss below. This
was the greatest waterfall of the Nile; and in honour of the
distinguished president of the Royal Geographical Society, I named
it the Murchison Falls.</p>

<p>Of course, we could proceed no farther by canoe, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span> landed
at a deserted village. Our riding oxen had died; and we had to get
some natives as porters. My wife was carried on a litter, and I was
scarcely able to crawl; but after tremendous difficulties and
dangers we reached, following the bank of the Somerset, on April 8,
the island of Patoo&#257;n, within eighteen miles of where we had
first struck the river at Karuma. My exploration was, therefore,
complete; but our difficulties were not at an end. We were detained
for two months at Shooa Mor&#363;, practically deserted by everyone
except our two personal attendants, and all but starved.</p>

<p>[The real Kamrasi, for the man Baker and his party had seen on
their outward journey was only his brother M'Gambi, afterwards came
on the scene, took them to Kisoona, and there and at other places
detained them practically prisoners during the long and cruel wars
with his rivals, Fawooka and Rionga and the King of Uganda. On
November 17, Baker escaped with his wife and a small party and
marched through the Shooa country and the country of the Madi to
the Asua River, only a quarter of a mile from its junction with the
Nile. Then they crossed the country of the Bari, and arrived at
Gondokoro, whence they sailed down the Nile to Khartoum, which was
reached on May 5, 1865, two years and five months after their start
from that city.]</p>

<h4>GEORGE BORROW</h4>

<h4>Wild Wales</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Its People, Language and
Scenery</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Although the tour in Wales upon which this work was founded took
place in 1854, and although the book was completed in 1857, it was
not published until 1862. It received curt treatment from most of
the critics, but the "Spectator" declared that Borrow (see <span
class="smcap">Fiction</span>) had written "the best book about
Wales ever published." This verdict has been endorsed by admirers
of Wales and of Borrow. Less imaginative than his earlier works, it
is more natural and cheerful; it is a faithful record of studies of
Welsh scenery and characteristics, and affords many a delightful
glimpse of the quaint personality of its author.</p>
</div>

<p>In the summer of the year 1854, myself, wife and daughter
determined upon going into Wales to pass a few months there. It was
my knowledge of Welsh, such as it was, that made me desirous that
we should go to Wales. In my boyhood I had been something of a
philologist, and had learnt some Welsh, partly from books and
partly from a Welsh groom. I was well versed in the compositions of
various of the old Welsh bards, especially those of Dafydd ab
Gwilym, whom I have always considered as the greatest poetical
genius that has appeared in Europe since the revival of
literature.</p>

<p>So our little family started for Wales on July 27, and next day
we arrived at Chester. Three days later I sent my wife and daughter
by train to Llangollen, and on the following morning I left Chester
for Llangollen on foot. After passing through Wrexham, I soon
reached Rhiwabon, whence my way lay nearly west. A woman passed me
going towards Rhiwabon. I pointed to a ridge to the east, and asked
its name. The woman shook her head and replied, "Dim Saesneg" (No
English).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">
14</a></span></p>

<p>"This is as it should be," said I to myself; "I now feel I am in
Wales." I repeated the question in Welsh.</p>

<p>"Cefn bach," she replied&mdash;which signifies the little
ridge.</p>

<p>"Diolch iti," I replied, and proceeded on my way.</p>

<p>On arriving at Llangollen I found my wife and daughter at the
principal inn. During dinner we had music, for a Welsh harper
stationed in the passage played upon his instrument "Codiad yr
ehedydd." "Of a surety," said I, "I am in Wales!"</p>

<p>The beautiful valley of the Dee, or Dwy, of which the Llangollen
district forms part, is called in the British tongue Glyndyfrdwy.
The celebrated Welsh chieftain, generally known as Owen Glendower,
was surnamed after the valley, which belonged to him.</p>

<p>Connected with the Dee there is a wonderful Druidical legend to
the following effect. The Dee springs from two fountains, high up
in Merionethshire, called Dwy Fawr and Dwy Fach, or the great and
little Dwy, whose waters pass through those of the lake of Bala
without mingling with them, and come out at its northern extremity.
These fountains had their names from two individuals, Dwy Fawr and
Dwy Fach, who escaped from the Deluge, and the passing of the
waters of the two fountains through the lake, without being
confounded with its flood, is emblematic of the salvation of the
two individuals from the Deluge, of which the lake is a type.</p>

<p>I remained at Llangollen for nearly a month, first of all
ascending to Dinas Bran, a ruined stronghold of unknown antiquity,
which crowns the top of the mighty hill on the northern side of the
valley; then walking more than once over the Berwyn hills; then
visiting the abbey of the Vale of the Cross, where lies buried the
poet Iolo Goch, the friend of Owen Glendower; then making an
expedition on foot to Ruthin.</p>

<p>Before leaving Llangollen I went over the Berwyn again to the
valley of Ceiriog, to see the birthplace of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span> Huw Morris, the
great Royalist poet, whose pungent satires of King Charles's foes
ran like wild fire through Wales. Through a maze of tangled shrubs,
in pouring rain, I was led to his chair&mdash;a mouldering stone
slab forming the seat, and a large slate stone the back, with the
poet's initials cut in it. I uncovered, and said in the best Welsh
I could command, "Shade of Huw Morris, a Saxon has come to this
place to pay that respect to true genius which he is ever ready to
pay." I then sat down in the chair, and commenced repeating the
verses of Huw Morris. The Welsh folk who were with me listened
patiently and approvingly in the rain, for enthusiasm is never
scoffed at by the noble, simple-minded, genuine Welsh, whatever
treatment it may receive from the coarse-hearted, sensual, selfish
Saxon.</p>

<p>On a brilliant Sunday morning in late August, I left Llangollen
on foot for Bangor, Snowdon and Anglesey. I walked through Corwen
to Cerrig y Drudion, within sight of Snowdon. At the inn, where I
spent the night, the landlady remarked that it was odd that the
only two people not Welshmen she had ever known who could speak
Welsh should be in her house at the same time. The other man, I
found, was an Italian of Como, with whom I conversed in his native
tongue.</p>

<p>Next morning I started to walk to Bangor, a distance of
thirty-four miles. After passing across a stretch of flat country,
I reached Pentre Voelas, and soon found myself in a wild hilly
region. Presently I arrived at a cottage just inside the door of
which sat a good-looking, middle-aged woman, engaged in knitting,
the general occupation of Welsh females.</p>

<p>"Good-day," said I to her in Welsh. "Fine weather."</p>

<p>"In truth, sir, it is fine weather for the harvest."</p>

<p>"Are you alone in the house?"</p>

<p>"I am, sir; my husband has gone to his labour."</p>

<p>"Have you any children?"</p>

<p>"Two, sir, but they are out in service."<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"What is the name of the river near here?"</p>

<p>"It is called the Conway. You have heard of it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Heard of it! It is one of the famous rivers of the world. One
of the great poets of my country calls it the old Conway."</p>

<p>"Is one river older than another, sir?"</p>

<p>"That's a shrewd question. Can you read?"</p>

<p>"I can, sir."</p>

<p>"Have you any books?"</p>

<p>"I have the Bible, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you show it me?"</p>

<p>"Willingly, sir."</p>

<p>On opening the book the first words which met my eye were "Gad i
my fyned trwy dy dir!" (Let me go through your country. Numbers xx.
22.)</p>

<p>"I may say these words," said I&mdash;"let me go through your
country."</p>

<p>"No one will hinder you, sir, for you seem a civil
gentleman."</p>

<p>"No one has hindered me hitherto. Wherever I have been in Wales
I have experienced nothing but kindness."</p>

<p>"What country is yours, sir?"</p>

<p>"England. Did you not know that by my tongue?"</p>

<p>"I did not, sir. I took you for a Cumro of the south."</p>

<p>I departed, and proceeded through a truly magnificent country to
the celebrated Vale of Conway. Then I turned westwards to Capel
Curig, and from there walked through a bleak moor amidst wild,
sterile hills, and down a gloomy valley with enormous rock walls on
either hand, to Bethesda and Bangor, where my family awaited
me.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;On Snowdon's Lofty
Summit</i></div>

<p>On the third morning after our arrival at Bangor, we set out for
Snowdon. Snowdon is interesting on various accounts. It is
interesting for its picturesque beauty; it is interesting from its
connection with Welsh history.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>But it is from its connection with romance that Snowdon derives
its chief interest. Who, when he thinks of Snowdon, does not
associate it with the heroes of romance, Arthur and his
knights?</p>

<p>We went through Carnarvon to Llanberis, and there I started with
Henrietta, my daughter, to ascend the hill, my wife not deeming
herself sufficiently strong to encounter the fatigue of the
expedition. For some way the ascent was anything but steep, but
towards the summit the path became much harder; at length, however,
we stood safe and sound upon the very top of Snowdon.</p>

<p>"Here," said I to Henrietta, "you are on the top crag of
Snowdon, which the Welsh consider, and perhaps with justice, to be
the most remarkable crag in the world; which is mentioned in many
of their old wild romantic tales, and some of the noblest of their
poems, amongst others, in the 'Day of Judgment,' by the illustrious
Goronwy Owen."</p>

<p>To this harangue Henrietta listened with attention; three or
four English, who stood nigh, with grinning scorn, and a Welsh
gentleman with much interest.</p>

<p>The Welshman, coming forward, shook me by the hand, exclaiming,
"Wyt ti Lydaueg?" (Are you from Brittany?)</p>

<p>"I am not a Llydauan," said I; "I wish I was, or anything but
what I am, one of a nation amongst whom any knowledge, save what
relates to money-making, is looked upon as a disgrace. I am ashamed
to say that I am an Englishman."</p>

<p>My family then returned to Llangollen, whilst I took a trip into
Anglesey to visit Llanfair, the birth-place of the great poet,
Goronwy Owen, whose works I had read with enthusiasm in my early
years. I went on to Holyhead, and ascended the headland. The
prospect, on every side, was noble, and in some respects this Pen
Santaidd reminded me of Finisterra, the Gallegan promontory which I
had ascended some seventeen years before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>Next morning I departed for Beddgelert by way of Carnarvon.
After passing by Lake Cwellyn, where I conversed with the Snowdon
ranger, an elderly man who is celebrated as the tip-top guide to
Snowdon, I reached Beddgelert, and found the company at the hotel
there perhaps even more disagreeable than that which I had left
behind at Bangor. Beddgelert is the scene of the legend of Llywelyn
ab Jorwerth's dog Gelert, a legend which, whether true or
fictitious, is singularly beautiful and affecting. On the way to
Festiniog next day I entered a refreshment-place, where I was given
a temperance drink that was much too strong for me. By mixing it
with plenty of water, I made myself a beverage tolerable enough; a
poor substitute, however, to a genuine Englishman for his proper
drink, the liquor which, according to the Edda, is called by men
ale, and by the gods, beer. Between this place and Tan-y-Bwlch I
lost my way. I obtained a wonderful view of the Wyddfa towering in
sublime grandeur to the west, and of the beautiful but spectral
mountain Knicht in the north; to the south the prospect was noble
indeed&mdash;waters, forests, hoary mountains, and, in the far
distance, the sea. But I underwent sore hardships ere I found my
way again, and I was feeling much exhausted when I entered the
Grapes Inn at Tan-y-Bwlch.</p>

<p>In the parlour was a serious-looking gentleman, with whom, as I
sipped my brandy-and-water, I entered into a discourse that soon
took a religious turn. He told me that he believed in Divine
pre-destination, and that he did not hope to be saved; he was
pre-destined to be lost. I disputed the point with him for a
considerable time, and left him looking very miserable, perhaps at
finding that he was not quite so certain of eternal damnation as he
had hitherto supposed.</p>

<p>An hour's walking brought me to Festiniog, the birth-place of
Rhys Goch, a celebrated bard, and a partisan of Owen Glendower.
Next morning I crossed a wild and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span> cheerless moor that
extended for miles and miles, and entered a valley with an enormous
hill on my right. Presently meeting four men, I asked the foremost
of them its name.</p>

<p>"Arenig Vawr," he replied, or something like it. I asked if
anybody lived upon it.</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "too cold for man."</p>

<p>"Fox?" said I.</p>

<p>"No! too cold for fox."</p>

<p>"Crow?" said I.</p>

<p>"No; too cold for crow; crow would be starved upon it." He then
looked me in the face, expecting probably that I should smile. I,
however, looked at him with all the gravity of a judge, whereupon
he also observed the gravity of a judge, and we continued looking
at each other with all the gravity of judges till we both
simultaneously turned away.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards I came to a beautiful valley; a more
bewitching scene I never beheld. I was now within three miles of
Bala, where I spent the night at an excellent inn. The name of the
lake of Bala is Llyn Tegid, which signifies Lake of Beauty; and
certainly this name was not given for nothing.</p>

<p>Next day, shortly after sunset, I reached my family at
Llangollen, and remained there for some weeks, making excursions to
Chirk Castle and elsewhere. On October 21 I left my family to make
preparations for their return to England, and myself departed for
South Wales.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Wanderings in South
Wales</i></div>

<p>I walked first to Llan Rhyadr, visited Sycharth and Llan Silin,
where Huw Morris is buried, saw the cataract of the Rhyadr, and
crossed the hills to Bala. After remaining a day in this beautiful
neighbourhood, I crossed a stupendous pass to Dinas Mawddwy, in the
midst of the region once inhabited by the red-haired banditti
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span> Mawddwy, the terror of the greater part of North
Wales. From there I passed down a romantic gorge, through which
flows the Royal Dyfi, to Mallwyd, where I spent the night.</p>

<p>Next morning I descended the valley of the Dyfi to Machynlleth,
a thoroughly Welsh town situated among pleasant green meadows. At
Machynlleth, in 1402, Owen Glendower held a parliament, and was
formally crowned King of Wales. To Machynlleth came Dafydd Gam,
with the view of assassinating Owen, who, however, had him seized
and conducted in chains to a prison in the mountains of
Sycharth.</p>

<p>On November 2, I left Machynlleth by a steep hill to the south,
whence there is a fine view of the Dyfi valley, and set out for the
Devil's Bridge. The road was at first exceedingly good, and the
scenery beautiful. Afterwards I had to pass over very broken
ground, and the people of whom I asked my way were Saxon-haters and
uncivil. Night was coming on fast when I reached the inn of Pont
Erwyd.</p>

<p>Next day I went on to the Devil's Bridge in the agreeable
company of a Durham mining captain, who had come to this country
thirty-five years before to help in opening Wales&mdash;that is, by
mining in Wales in the proper fashion, which means the
North-country fashion. Arrived at the Devil's Bridge, I viewed its
magnificent scenery, and especially observed the cave of the Wicked
Children, the mysterious Plant de Bat, sons of Bat or Bartholomew,
who concealed themselves in this recess and plundered the
neighbourhood. Finally, they fell upon a great gentleman on the
roads by night, and not only robbed, but murdered him. "That job
was the ruin of Plant de Bat," an old postman told me, "for the
great gentleman's friends hunted after his murderers with dogs, and
at length came to the cave, and, going in, found it stocked with
riches, and the Plant de Bat sitting upon the riches, not only the
boys, but their sister, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">21</a></span> was as bad as themselves. So they
took out the riches and the Plant de Bat, and the riches they did
give to churches and hospitals, and the Plant de Bat they did
execute, hanging the boys, and burning the girl."</p>

<p>After a visit to the Minister's Bridge, not far distant, a place
very wild and savage, but not comparable in sublimity with the
Devil's Bridge, I determined to ascend the celebrated mountain of
Plynlimmon, where arise the rivers Rheidol, Severn and Wye. I
caused my guide to lead me to the sources of each of the three
rivers. That of the Rheidol is a small, beautiful lake, overhung on
two sides by frightful crags. The source of the Severn is a little
pool some twenty inches long, covered at the bottom with small
stones; the source of the Wye is a pool not much larger. The
fountain of the Rheidol stands apart from the others, as if, proud
of its own beauty, it disdained their homeliness. I drank deeply at
all three sources.</p>

<p>Next day I went by Hafod and Spitty Ystwith over a bleak
moorland country to the valley of the Teivi, and turned reverently
aside to the celebrated monastery of Strata Florida, where is
buried Dafydd ab Gwilym, the greatest genius of the Cymbric race.
In this neighbourhood I heard a great deal of the exploits of Twm
Shone Catti, the famous Welsh robber, who became a country
gentleman and a justice of the peace.</p>

<p>From Tregaron, eight miles beyond Strata Florida, I went on to
Llan Ddewi Brefi and Lampeter, and crossed over to Llandovery in
the fair valley of the Towy. From there I went over the Black
Mountains, in mist and growing darkness, to Gutter Vawr, and thence
to Swansea. Through a country blackened with industry, I walked to
Neath; thence in rainy weather to Merthyr Tydvil, where I went to
see the Cyfartha Fawr Ironworks. Here I saw enormous furnaces and
heard all kinds of dreadful sounds.</p>

<p>From Merthyr Tydvil I journeyed to Caerfili by Pen-y-Glas; then
to Newport; then by Caer Went, once an<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span> important Roman
station and now a poor, desolate place, to Chepstow. I went to the
Wye and drank of the waters at its mouth, even as some time before
I had drunk of the waters at its source. Returning to the inn, I
got my dinner, and placing my feet against the sides of the grate I
drank wine and sang Welsh songs till ten o'clock. Then, shouldering
my satchel, I proceeded to the railroad station and took a
first-class ticket to London.</p>

<h4><a name="Page_22a" id="Page_22a">The Bible in Spain</a></h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The First Journey</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In 1835 George Henry Borrow, fresh from a journey in Russia as
the Bible Society's agent, set out for Spain to sell and distribute
Bibles on the Society's behalf. This mission, in the most fervidly
Roman Catholic of all European countries, was one that required
rare courage and resourcefulness; and Borrow's task was complicated
by the fact that Spain was in a disturbed state owing to the
Carlist insurrection. Borrow's journeys in Spain, which were
preceded by a tour in Portugal, and followed by a visit to Morocco,
lasted in all about four years. In December, 1842, he published
"The Bible in Spain"&mdash;a work less remarkable as a record of
missionary effort than as a vivid narrative of picturesque travel
episodes, and a testimony to its author's keen delight in an
adventurous life of wanderings in the open air.</p>
</div>

<p>I landed at Lisbon on November 12, 1835; and on January 5, 1836,
I spurred down the hill of Elvas, on the Portuguese frontier, eager
to arrive in old chivalrous romantic Spain. In little more than
half an hour we arrived at a brook, whose waters ran vigorously
between steep banks. A man who was standing on the side directed me
to the ford in the squeaking dialect of Portugal; but whilst I was
yet splashing through the water, a voice from the other bank hailed
me, in the magnificent language of Spain, in this guise: "Charity,
Sir Cavalier, for the love of God bestow an alms upon me, that I
may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span> purchase a mouthful of red wine!" In a moment I was
on Spanish ground, and, having flung the beggar a small piece of
silver, I cried in ecstasy: "Santiago y cierra Espa&ntilde;a!" and
scoured on my way with more speed than before.</p>

<p>I was now within half a league of Badajoz, where I spent the
next three weeks. It was here that I first fell in with those
singular people, the Zincali, Gitanos, or Spanish gypsies. My time
was chiefly devoted to the gypsies, among whom, from long
intercourse with various sections of their race in different parts
of the world, I felt myself much more at home than with the silent,
reserved men of Spain, with whom a foreigner might mingle for half
a century without having half a dozen words addressed to him. So
when the fierce gypsy, Antonio Lopez, offered to accompany me as
guide on my journey towards Madrid, I accepted his offer. After a
few days of travelling in his company I was nearly arrested on
suspicion by a national guard, but was saved by my passport. In
fact, my appearance was by no means calculated to prepossess people
in my favour. Upon my head I wore an old Andalusian hat; a rusty
cloak, which had perhaps served half a dozen generations, enwrapped
my body. My face was plentifully bespattered with mud, and upon my
chin was a beard of a week's growth.</p>

<p>I took leave of Antonio at the summit of the Pass of Mirabete,
and descended alone, occasionally admiring one of the finest
prospects in the world; before me outstretched lay immense plains,
bounded in the distance by huge mountains, whilst at the foot of
the hill rolled the Tagus in a deep narrow stream, between lofty
banks.</p>

<p>Early in February I reached Madrid. I hoped to obtain permission
from the government to print the new Testament in the Castilian
language, for circulation in Spain, and lost no time in seeing
Mendizabal, the Prime Minister. He was a bitter enemy to the Bible
Society;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span> but I pressed upon him so successfully that
eventually I obtained a promise that at the expiration of a few
months, when he hoped the country would be in a more tranquil
state, I should be allowed to print the Scriptures. He told me to
call upon him again at the end of three months. Before that time
had elapsed, however, he had fallen into disgrace, and his Ministry
had been succeeded by another. At the outset, in spite of
assistance from the British Minister, I could only get evasions
from the new government.</p>

<p>I had nothing to do but wait, and I used to loiter for hours
along the delightful banks of the canal that runs parallel with the
River Manzanares, listening to the prattle of the narangero, or man
who sold oranges and water. He was a fellow of infinite drollery;
his knowledge of individuals was curious and extensive, few people
passing his stall with whose names, character, and history he was
not acquainted.</p>

<p>"Those two boys are the children of Gabiria, comptroller of the
Queen's household, and the richest man in Madrid. They are nice
boys, and buy much fruit. The old woman who is lying beneath yon
tree is the Tia Lucilla; she has committed murders, and as she owes
me money, I hope one day to see her executed. This man was of the
Walloon guard&mdash;Se&ntilde;or Don Benito Mol, how do you
do?"</p>

<p>This last-named personage instantly engrossed my attention; he
was a bulky old man, with ruddy features, and eyes that had an
expression of great eagerness, as if he were expecting the
communication of some important tidings. He returned the salutation
of the orange-man, and, bowing to me, forthwith produced two
scented wash-balls, which he offered for sale in a rough dissonant
jargon.</p>

<p>Upon my asking him who he was, the following conversation ensued
between us.</p>

<p>"I am a Swiss of Lucerne, Benedict Mol by name,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span> once a
soldier in the Walloon guard, and now a soap-boiler, at your
service."</p>

<p>"You speak the language of Spain very imperfectly," said I. "How
long have you been in the country?"</p>

<p>"Forty-five years," replied Benedict. "But when the guard was
broken up I went to Minorca, where I lost the Spanish language
without acquiring the Catalan. I will now speak Swiss to you, for,
if I am not much mistaken, you are a German man, and understand the
speech of Lucerne. I intend shortly to return to Lucerne, and live
there like a duke."</p>

<p>"Have you, then, realised a large capital in Spain?" said I,
glancing at his hat and the rest of his apparel.</p>

<p>"Not a cuart, not a cuart; these two wash-balls are all that I
possess."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are the son of good parents, and have lands and
money in your own country wherewith to support yourself?"</p>

<p>"Not a heller, not a heller; my father was hangman of Lucerne,
and when he died his body was seized to pay his debts." When he
went back to Lucerne, added Benedict, it would be in a coach drawn
by six mules, with treasure, a mighty schatz, which lay in a
certain church at Compostella, in Galicia. He had learnt the secret
of it from a dying soldier of the Walloon guard, who, with two
companions, had buried in the church a great booty they had made in
Portugal. It consisted of gold moidores and of a packet of huge
diamonds from the Brazils. The whole was contained in a large
copper kettle. "It is very easy to find, for the dying man was so
exact in his description of the place where it lies that were I
once at Compostella, I should have no difficulty in putting my hand
upon it. Several times I have been on the point of setting out on
the journey, but something has always happened to stop me."</p>

<p>At various times during the next two years I again met Benedict
Mol.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>When next I called upon the new Prime Minister, Isturitz, I
found him well disposed to favour my views, and I obtained an
understanding that my Biblical pursuits would be tolerated in
Spain. The Minister was in a state of extreme depression, which was
indeed well grounded; for within a week there occurred a revolution
in which his party, the Moderados, were overthrown by the
Nacionals. I watched the fighting from an upper window, in the
company of my friend D&mdash;&mdash;, of the "Morning Chronicle."
Afterwards I returned to England, for the purpose of consulting
with my friends, and planning a Biblical campaign.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Travels in Northern
Spain</i></div>

<p>In November I sailed from the Thames to Cadiz, and reached
Madrid by Seville and Cordova. I found that I could commence
printing the Scriptures without any further applications to the
government. Within three months of my arrival an edition of the New
Testament, consisting of 5,000 copies, was published at Madrid. I
then prepared to ride forth, Testament in hand, and endeavour to
circulate the Word of God amongst the Spaniards.</p>

<p>First, I purchased a horse. He was a black Andalusian stallion
of great power and strength, but he was unbroke, savage, and
furious. A cargo of Bibles, however, which I hoped occasionally to
put on his back, would, I had no doubt, thoroughly tame him. I then
engaged a servant, a wandering Greek, named Antonio Buchini; his
behaviour was frequently in the highest degree extraordinary, but
he served me courageously and faithfully. The state of the
surrounding country was not very favourable for setting forth;
Cabrera, the Carlist, was within nine leagues of Madrid, with an
army nearly 10,000 strong; nevertheless, about the middle of<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
May I bade farewell to my friends, and set out for Salamanca.</p>

<p>A melancholy town is Salamanca; the days of its collegiate glory
are long since past, never more to return; a circumstance, however,
which is little to be regretted, for what benefit did the world
ever derive from scholastic philosophy? The principal bookseller of
the town consented to become my agent here, and I, in consequence,
deposited in his shop a certain number of New Testaments. I
repeated this experiment in all the large towns which I visited and
distributed them likewise as I rode along.</p>

<p>The posada where I put up at Salamanca was a good specimen of
the old Spanish inn. Opposite to my room lodged a wounded officer;
he was attended by three broken soldiers, lame or maimed, and unfit
for service; they were quite destitute of money, and the officer
himself was poor and had only a few dollars. Brave guests for an
inn, thought I; yet, to the honour of Spain be it spoken, it is one
of the few countries in Europe where poverty is never insulted nor
looked upon with contempt. Even at an inn the poor man is never
spurned from the door, and if not harboured, is at least dismissed
with fair words, and consigned to the mercy of God and his mother.
This is as it should be. I laugh at the bigotry and prejudices of
Spain; I abhor the cruelty and ferocity which have cast a stain of
eternal infamy on her history; but I will say for the Spaniards
that in their social intercourse no people in the world exhibit a
juster feeling of what is due to the dignity of human nature, or
better understand the behaviour which it behoves a man to adopt
towards his fellow beings.</p>

<p>We travelled on by Valladolid, Leon and Astorga, and entered the
terrific mountains of Galicia. After a most difficult journey,
along precipitous tracks that were reported to be infested by
brigands, we reached Coru&ntilde;a, where stands the tomb of Mocre,
built by the chivalrous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id=
"Page_28">28</a></span> French in commemoration of the fall of
their heroic antagonist. Many acquire immortality without seeking
it, and die before its first ray has gilded their name; of these
was Moore. There is scarcely a Spaniard but has heard of his tomb,
and speaks of it with a strange kind of awe.</p>

<p>At the commencement of August I found myself at St. James of
Compostella. A beautiful town is St. James, standing on a pleasant
level amidst mountains. Time has been when, with the single
exception of Rome, it was the most celebrated resort of pilgrims in
the world. Its glory, however, as a place of pilgrimage is rapidly
passing away.</p>

<p>I was walking late one night alone in the Alameda, when a man
dressed in coarse brown garments took off his hat and demanded
charity in uncouth tones. "Benedict Mol," said I, "is it possible
that I see you at Compostella?"</p>

<p>It was indeed Benedict. He had walked all the way from Madrid,
supporting himself by begging.</p>

<p>"What motive could possibly bring you such a distance?" I asked
him.</p>

<p>"I come for the schatz&mdash;the treasure. Ow, I do not like
this country of Galicia at all; all my bones are sore since I
entered Galicia."</p>

<p>"And yet you have come to this country in search of
treasure?"</p>

<p>"Ow yaw, but the schatz is buried; it is not above ground; there
is no money above ground in Galicia. I must dig it up; and when I
have dug it up I will purchase a coach with six mules, and ride out
of Galicia to Lucerne."</p>

<p>I gave him a dollar, and told him that as for the treasure he
had come to seek, probably it only existed in his own
imagination.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">29</a></span><i>III.&mdash;The Alcalde of
Finisterra</i></div>

<p>After a visit to Pontevedra and Vigo, I returned to Padron,
three leagues from Compostella, and decided to hire a guide to Cape
Finisterra. It would be difficult to assign any plausible reason
for the ardent desire which I entertained to visit this place; but
I thought that to convey the Gospel to a place so wild and remote
might perhaps be considered an acceptable pilgrimage in the eyes of
my Maker.</p>

<p>The first guide I employed deserted me; the second did not
appear to know the way, and sought to escape from me; and when I
tried to pursue him, my horse bolted and nearly broke my neck. I
caught the guide at last. After a very rough journey we reached the
village of Finisterra, and wound our way up the flinty sides of the
huge bluff head which is called the Cape. Certainly in the whole
world there is no bolder coast than the Gallegan shore. There is an
air of stern and savage grandeur in everything around, which
strangely captivates the imagination. After gazing from the summit
of the Cape for nearly an hour we descended to the village. On
reaching the house where we had taken up our habitation, I flung
myself on a rude and dirty bed, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>I was suddenly, however, seized roughly by the shoulder and
nearly dragged from the bed. I looked up in amazement, and I beheld
hanging over me a wild and uncouth figure; it was that of an
elderly man, built as strong as a giant, in the habiliments of a
fisherman; in his hand was a rusty musket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> Who are you and what do you
want? By what authority do you thus presume to interfere with
me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Figure:</span> By the authority of the
Justicia of Finisterra. Follow me peaceably, Calros, or it will be
the worse with you.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id=
"Page_30">30</a></span>"Calros," said I, "what does the person mean?" I thought it,
however, most prudent to obey his command, and followed him down
the staircase. The shop and the portal were now thronged with the
inhabitants of Finisterra, men, women, and children. Through this
crowd the figure pushed his way with an air of authority. "It is
Calros! It is Calros!" said a hundred voices; "he has come to
Finisterra at last, and the justicia have now got hold of him."</p>

<p>At last we reached a house of rather larger size than the rest;
my guide having led me into a long, low room, placed me in the
middle of the floor, and then hurrying to the door, he endeavoured
to repulse the crowd who strove to enter with us. I now looked
around the room. It was rather scantily furnished; I could see
nothing but some tubs and barrels, the mast of a boat, and a sail
or two. Seated upon the tubs were three or four men coarsely
dressed, like fishermen or shipwrights. The principal personage was
a surly, ill-tempered-looking fellow of about thirty-five, whom I
discovered to be the alcalde of Finisterra. After I had looked
about me for a minute, the alcalde, giving his whiskers a twist,
thus addressed me:</p>

<p>"Who are you, where is your passport, and what brings you to
Finisterra?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> I am an Englishman. Here is
my passport, and I came to see Finisterra.</p>

<p>This reply seemed to discomfit them for a moment. They looked at
each other, then at my passport. At length the alcalde, striking it
with his finger, bellowed forth, "This is no Spanish passport; it
appears to be written in French."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> I have already told you that
I am a foreigner. I, of course, carry a foreign passport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> Then you mean to assert that
you are not Calros Rey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> I never heard before of such
a king, nor indeed of such a name.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> Hark to the fellow; he has
the audacity to say that he has never heard of Calros the
pretender, who calls himself king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> If you mean by Calros the
pretender Don Carlos, all I can reply is that you can scarcely be
serious. You might as well assert that yonder poor fellow, my
guide, whom I see you have made prisoner, is his nephew, the
infante Don Sebastian.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> See, you have betrayed
yourself; that is the very person we suppose him to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> It is true that they are both
hunchbacks. But how can I be like Don Carlos? I have nothing the
appearance of a Spaniard, and am nearly a foot taller than the
pretender.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> That makes no difference;
you, of course, carry many waistcoats about you, by means of which
you disguise yourself, and appear tall or low according to your
pleasure.</p>

<p>This last was so conclusive an argument that I had of course
nothing to reply to it. "Yes, it is Calros; it is Calros," said the
crowd at the door.</p>

<p>"It will be as well to have these men shot instantly," continued
the alcalde; " if they are not the two pretenders, they are at any
rate two of the factious."</p>

<p>"I am by no means certain that they are either one or the
other," said a gruff voice. Our glances rested upon the figure who
held watch at the door. He had planted the barrel of his musket on
the floor, and was leaning his chin against the butt.</p>

<p>"I have been examining this man," he continued, pointing to
myself, "and listening whilst he spoke, and it appears to me that
after all he may prove an Englishman; he has their very look and
voice."</p>

<p>Here the alcalde became violently incensed. "He is no more an
Englishman than yourself," he exclaimed; "if he were an Englishman,
would he have come in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">32</a></span> manner, skulking across the land?
Not so I trow. He would have come in a ship."</p>

<p>After a fierce dispute between the alcalde and the guard, it was
decided to remove us to Corcuvion, where the head alcalde was to
dispose of us as he thought proper.</p>

<p>The head alcalde was a mighty liberal and a worshipper of Jeremy
Bentham. "The most universal genius which the world ever produced,"
he called him. "I am most truly glad to see a countryman of his in
these Gothic wildernesses. Stay, I think I see a book in your
hand."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> The New Testament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> Why do you carry such a book
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Myself:</span> One of my principal motives
in visiting Finisterra was to carry this book to that wild
place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alcalde:</span> Ah, ah! how very singular.
Yes, I remember. I have heard that the English highly prize this
eccentric book. How very singular that the countrymen of the grand
Bentham should set any value upon that old monkish book.</p>

<p>I told him that I had read none of Bentham's writings; but
nevertheless I had to thank that philosopher not only for my
release, but for hospitable treatment during the rest of my stay in
the region of Finisterra.</p>

<p>From Corcuvion I returned to Compostella and Coru&ntilde;a, and
then directed my course to Asturias. At Oviedo, I again met
Benedict Mol. He had sought to get permission to disinter the
treasure, and had not succeeded. He had then tried to reach France,
begging by the way. He was in villainous apparel, and nearly
barefooted. He promised to quit Spain and return to Lucerne, and I
gave him a few dollars.</p>

<p>"A strange man is this Benedict," said my servant Antonio. "A
strange life he has led and a strange death he will die&mdash;it is
written on his countenance. That he will leave Spain I do not
believe, or, if he leave it, it<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span> will only be to return,
for he is bewitched about this same treasure."</p>

<p>Soon afterwards I returned to Madrid. During my northern
journey, which occupied a considerable portion of the year 1837, I
had accomplished less than I proposed to myself. Something,
however, had been effected. The New Testament was now enjoying a
quiet sale in the principal towns of the north.</p>

<p>I had, moreover, disposed of a considerable number of Testaments
with my own hands.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Persecution</i></div>

<p>I spent some months in Madrid translating the New Testament into
the Basque and Gypsy languages. During this time the hostility of
the priesthood to my labours became very bitter. The Governor of
Madrid forbade the sale of Testaments in January, 1838; afterwards
all copies of the Gypsy Gospel were confiscated, and in May I was
thrown into prison. I went cheerfully enough, knowing that the
British Embassy was actively working for my release; and the
governor of the prison, one of the greatest rascals in all Spain,
greeted me with a most courteous speech in pure sonorous Castilian,
bidding me consider myself as a guest rather than a prisoner, and
permitting me to roam over every part of the gaol.</p>

<p>What most surprised me with respect to the prisoners was their
good behaviour. I call it good when all things are taken into
consideration. They had their occasional bursts of wild gaiety,
their occasional quarrels, which they were in the habit of settling
in a corner with their long knives; but, upon the whole, their
conduct was infinitely superior to what might have been expected.
Yet this was not the result of coercion, or any particular care
which was exercised over them; for perhaps in no part of the world
are prisoners so left to themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> and so utterly neglected
as in Spain. Yet in this prison of Madrid the ears of the visitor
are never shocked with horrid blasphemy and profanity, nor are his
eyes outraged and himself insulted. And yet in this prison were
some of the most desperate characters in Spain. But gravity and
sedateness are the leading characteristics of the Spaniards, and
the very robber, except in those moments when he is engaged in his
occupation, and then no one is more sanguinary, pitiless, and
wolfishly eager for booty, is a being who can be courteous and
affable, and who takes pleasure in conducting himself with sobriety
and decorum.</p>

<p>After a stay of three weeks in the prison I was released, as I
expected, with an apology, and I prepared for another journey.
While in prison I had been visited by Benedict Mol, again in
Madrid. Soon after my release he came in high spirits to bid me
farewell before starting for Compostella to dig up the schatz. He
was dressed in new clothes; instead of the ragged staff he had
usually borne, he carried a huge bamboo rattan. He had endured
terrible privations, he said, in the mountains. But one night he
had heard among the rocks a mysterious voice telling him that the
way to the treasure lay through Madrid. To Madrid he had come, and
the government, hoping for a replenishment of its empty treasury,
had given him permission to search for the treasure.</p>

<p>"Well, Benedict," I told him, "I have nothing to say save that I
hope you will succeed in your digging."</p>

<p>"Thank you, lieber Herr, thank you!" Here he stopped short and
started. "Heiliger Gott! Suppose I should not find the treasure,
after all?"</p>

<p>"Very rationally said. It is not too late. Put on your old
garments, grasp your ragged staff, and help me to circulate the
Gospel."</p>

<p>He mused for a moment, then shook his head. "No,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span> no," he
cried; "I must accomplish my destiny! I shall find it&mdash;the
schatz&mdash;it is still there&mdash;it <i>must</i> be there!"</p>

<p>He went, and I never saw him more. What I heard, however, was
extraordinary enough. The treasure hunt at Compostella was
conducted in a public and imposing manner. The bells pealed, the
populace thronged from their houses, troops were drawn up in the
square. A procession directed its course to the church; at its head
was the captain-general and the Swiss; numerous masons brought up
the rear. The procession enters the church, they pass through it in
solemn march, they find themselves in a vaulted passage. The Swiss
looks around. "Dig here!" said he. The masons labour, the floor is
broken up&mdash;a horrible fetid odour arises....</p>

<p>Enough; no treasure was found, and the unfortunate Swiss was
forthwith seized and flung into the horrid prison of Saint James,
amidst the execrations of thousands. Soon afterwards he was removed
from Saint James, whither I could not ascertain. It was said that
he disappeared on the road.</p>

<p>Where in the whole cycle of romance shall we find anything more
wild, grotesque and sad than the easily authenticated history of
the treasure-digger of Saint James.</p>

<p>A most successful journey, in which I distributed the Gospel
freely in the Sagra of Toledo and La Mancha, was interrupted by a
serious illness, which compelled me to return to Madrid, and
afterwards to visit England for a rest. On December 31, 1838, I
entered Spain for the third time. From Cadiz I travelled to Madrid
by Seville, and made a number of short journeys to the villages
near the capital. The clergy, however, had induced the government
to order the confiscation of all Testaments exposed for sale.
Prevented from labouring in the villages, I organised a
distribution of Testaments in Madrid itself. I then returned to
Seville; but even here I was troubled by the government's
orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span> for the seizure of Testaments. I had, however,
several hundred copies in my own possession, and I remained in
Seville for several months until I had disposed of them. I lived
there in extreme retirement; there was nothing to induce me to
enter much into society. The Andalusians, in all estimable traits
of character, are as far below the other Spaniards as the country
which they inhabit is superior in beauty and fertility to the other
provinces of Spain.</p>

<p>At the end of July, 1839, I went by steamer down the
Guadalquivir to Cadiz, then to Gibraltar, and thence across to
Tangier and the land of the Moors. I had a few Spanish Testaments
still in my possession, and my object was to circulate them among
the Christians of Tangier.</p>

narrative abruptly ends. Borrow returned from Morocco to England in
the spring of 1840.</p>

<h4>JAMES BOSWELL</h4>

<h4>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Edinburgh, Fifeshire, and
Aberdeen</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Boswell's first considerable book was a lively description of
his tour in Corsica, but his fame rests on his "Life of Dr.
Johnson" (see <span class="smcap">Lives and Letters</span>), and
his "Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson, LL.D."
was really the first portion of that great work, and was meant, as
he himself said, "to delineate Dr. Johnson's manners and character"
more than to give any detailed descriptions of scenery. We have
chosen to include it in the travel section of our work, however, as
it might be more readily looked for there than under "Johnson" in
the department of "Lives and Letters." The journal was published in
the autumn of 1785, about nine months after the death of
Johnson.</p>
</div>

<p>Dr. Johnson had for many years given me hopes that we should go
together and visit the Hebrides. In spring, 1773, he talked of
coming to Scotland that year with so much firmness that I hoped he
was at last in earnest. I knew that if he were once launched from
the metropolis he would go forward very well. Luckily, Mr. Justice
(now Sir Robert) Chambers conducted Dr. Johnson from London to
Newcastle; and Mr. Scott, of University College, Oxford,
accompanied him from thence to Edinburgh.</p>

<p>On Saturday, August 14, 1773, late in the evening, I received a
note from him, that he had arrived in Boyd's Inn, at the head of
the Canongate. I went to him directly. He embraced me cordially,
and I exulted in the thought that I had him actually in Caledonia.
He was to do me the honour to lodge under my roof. We walked
arm-in-arm up the High Street to my house in James's Court. It was
a dusky night; but he acknowledged that<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span> the breadth of the
street, and the loftiness of the buildings on each side, made a
noble appearance. My wife had tea ready, which it is well known he
delighted to drink at all hours; and he showed much complacency
upon finding that the mistress of the house was so attentive to his
singular habit. On Sunday, after dinner, Principal Robertson came
and drank wine with us, and there was some animated dialogue.
During the next two days we walked out that Dr. Johnson might see
some of the things which we have to show at Edinburgh, such as
Parliament House, where the lords of session now hold their courts,
the Advocates' Library, St. Giles's great church, the Royal
Infirmary, the Abbey of Holyrood House, and the Palace, where our
beautiful Queen Mary lived, and in which David Rizzio was
murdered.</p>

<p>We set out from Edinburgh on Wednesday, August 18, crossed the
Frith of Forth by boat, touching at the island of Inch Keith, and
landed in Fife at Kinghorn, where we took a post-chaise, and had a
dreary drive to St. Andrews. We arrived late, and were received at
St. Leonard's College by Professor Watson. We were conducted to see
St. Andrew, our oldest university, and the seat of our primate in
the days of episcopacy. Dr. Johnson's veneration for the hierarchy
affected him with a strong indignation while he beheld the ruins of
religious magnificence. I happened to ask where John Knox was
buried. Dr. Johnson burst out: "I hope in the highway! I have been
looking at his reformations."</p>

<p>We left St. Andrews August 20, and drove through Leuchars,
Dundee, and Aberbrothick to Montrose. Travelling onwards, we had
the Grampian Hills in view, and some good land around us, but void
of trees and hedges; and the Doctor observed that it was wonderful
to see a land so denuded of timber. Beyond Lawrence Kirk we visited
and dined with Lord Monboddo, and after a tedious journey we came
to Aberdeen. Next morning Principal Campbell and other college
professors called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
"Page_39">39</a></span> for us, and we went with them and saw
Marischal College.</p>

<p>Afterwards we waited on the magistrates in the Town Hall. They
had invited us to present Dr. Johnson with the freedom of the town,
which Provost Jopp did with a very good grace. Dr. Johnson was much
pleased with this mark of attention, and received it very politely.
It was striking to hear the numerous company drinking "Dr. Johnson!
Dr. Johnson!" and then to see him with his burgess ticket, or
diploma, in his hat, which he wore as he walked along the streets,
according to the usual custom. We dined with the provost and a
large company of professors at the house of Sir Alexander Gordon,
Professor of Medicine, but there was little or no conversation.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Through the Macbeth
Country</i></div>

<p>We resumed our journey northwards on the morning of August 24.
Having received a polite invitation to Slains Castle, we proceeded
thither, and were graciously welcomed. Lady Errol pressed us to
stay all night, and ordered the coach to carry us to see the great
curiosity on the coast at Dunbui, which is a monstrous cauldron,
called by the country people the Pot. Dr. Johnson insisted on
taking a boat and sailing into the Pot, and we found caves of
considerable depth on each side.</p>

<p>Returning to the castle, Dr. Johnson observed that its situation
was the noblest he had ever seen, better than Mount Edgcumbe,
reckoned the first in England. About nine, the earl, who had been
absent, came home. His agreeable manners and softness of address
prevented that constraint which the idea of his being Lord High
Constable of Scotland might otherwise have occasioned. He talked
very easily and sensibly with his learned guest. We left Slains
Castle next morning, and, driving by Banff and Elgin, where the
noble ruins of the cathedral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40"
id="Page_40">40</a></span> were examined by Dr. Johnson with a
patient attention, reached Forres on the night of August 26. That
afternoon we drove over the very heath where Macbeth met the
witches, according to tradition. Dr. Johnson solemnly recited:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">How far is't called to Forres?
What are these,</span> <span class="i0">So withered, and so wild is
their attire?</span> <span class="i0">They look not like the
inhabitants o' the earth,</span> <span class="i3">And yet are
on't.</span></div>
</div>

<p>From Forres we came to Nairn, and thence to the manse of the
minister of Calder, Mr. Kenneth Macaulay, author of the "History of
St. Kilda," where we stayed the night, after visiting the old
castle, the seat of the Thane of Cawdor. Thence we drove to Fort
George, where we dined with the governor, Sir Eyre Coote
(afterwards the gallant conqueror of Hyder Ali, and preserver of
our Indian Empire), and then got safely to Inverness. Next day we
went to Macbeth's Castle. I had a romantic satisfaction in seeing
Dr. Johnson actually in it. It perfectly corresponds with
Shakespeare's description, which Sir Joshua Reynolds has so happily
illustrated in one of his notes on our immortal poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">This castle has a pleasant
seat: the air</span> <span class="i0">Nimbly and sweetly recommends
itself</span><span class="i3">Unto our gentle senses.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Just as we came out of it a raven perched upon one of the
chimney-tops and croaked. Then I repeated:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i3">The raven himself is
hoarse,</span> <span class="i0">That croaks the fatal entrance of
Duncan</span> <span class="i0">Under my battlements.</span></div>
</div>

<p>On Monday, August 30, we began our equitation. We had three
horses for Dr. Johnson, myself, and Joseph, my servant, and one
which carried our portmanteaus, and two Highlanders walked along
with us. Dr. Johnson rode very well. It was a delightful day. Loch
Ness and the road upon the side of it, shaded with
birch-trees,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
"Page_41">41</a></span> pleased us much. The night was spent
at Fort Augustus, and the next two days we travelled through a wild
country, with prodigious mountains on each side.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;In the Misty Hebrides</i></div>

<p>We came at last to Glenelg, and next morning we got into a boat
for Sky, and reached the shore of Armidale. Sir Alexander
Macdonald, chief of the Macdonalds in the Isle of Sky, came down to
receive us. Armidale is situated on a pretty bay of the narrow sea
which flows between the mainland of Scotland and the Isle of Sky.
In front there is a grand prospect of the rude mountains Moidart
and Knoidart. Dr. Johnson and I were now full of the old Highland
spirit, and were dissatisfied at hearing of racked rents and
emigration, and finding a chief not surrounded by his clan. We
attempted in vain to communicate to him a portion of our
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>On September 6 we set out, accompanied by Mr. Donald Macleod as
our guide, for Corrichatachin, in the district of Strath. This farm
is possessed by Mr. Mackinnon, who received us with a hearty
welcome. The company was numerous and cheerful, and we, for the
first time, had a specimen of the joyous social manners of the
inhabitants of the Highlands. They talked in their own language
with fluent vivacity, and sang many Erse songs.</p>

<p>The following day the Rev. Donald Macqueen arrived to take us to
the Island of Rasay, in Macgillichallum's carriage. Along with him
came, as our pilot, Mr. Malcolm Macleod, one of the Rasay family,
celebrated in the year 1745-46. We got into Rasay's carriage, which
was a strong open boat. Dr. Johnson sat high on the stern like a
magnificent triton.</p>

<p>The approach to Rasay was very pleasing. We saw before us a
beautiful bay, well defended by a rocky coast, a good family
mansion, a fine verdure about it,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span> with a considerable
number of trees, and beyond it hills and mountains in gradation of
wildness. A large company came out from the house to meet us as we
landed, headed by Rasay himself, whose family has possessed this
island above four hundred years.</p>

<p>From Rasay we sailed to Portree, in Sky, and then rode in
wretched weather to Kingsburgh. There we were received by Mr. Allan
Macdonald and his wife, the celebrated Miss Flora Macdonald. She is
a little woman of a genteel appearance, and uncommonly mild and
well-bred. Dr. Johnson was rather quiescent, and went early to bed.
I slept in the same room with him. Each had a neat bed with tartan
curtains. Dr. Johnson's bed was the very bed in which the grandson
of the unfortunate King James II. lay on one of the nights after
the failure of his rash attempt in 1745-46.</p>

<p>To see Dr. Samuel Johnson lying in that bed in the Isle of Sky,
in the house of Miss Flora Macdonald, struck me with such a group
of ideas as is not easy for words to describe as they passed
through the mind. He smiled, and said: "I have no ambitious
thoughts in it." Upon the table I found in the morning a slip of
paper on which Dr. Johnson had written with his pencil these words:
"<i>Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum</i>" (With virtue weighed, what
worthless trash is gold). What the Doctor meant by writing them I
could not tell. At breakfast he said he would have given a good
deal rather than not have laid in that bed.</p>

<p>Kingsburgh sent us on our way by boat and on horseback to
Dunvegan Castle. The great size of the castle, which is built upon
a rock close to the sea, while the land around presents nothing but
wild, moorish, hilly, and scraggy appearances, gave a rude
magnificence to the scene. We were a jovial company, and the laird,
surrounded by so many of his clan, was to me a pleasing sight. They
listened with wonder and pleasure while Dr. Johnson harangued. The
weather having cleared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
"Page_43">43</a></span> we set out for Ulinish, the house of
Mr. Macleod, the sheriff-substitute of the island. From an old
tower near the house is an extensive view of Loch Bracadale, and,
at a distance, of the Isles of Barra and South Uist; and on the
land side the Cuillin, a prodigious range of mountains, capped with
rocky pinnacles, in a strange variety of shapes.</p>

<p>From there we came to Talisker, which is a beautiful place with
many well-grown trees, a wide expanse of sea and mountains, and,
within a quarter of a mile from the house, no less than fifteen
waterfalls. Mr. Donald Maclean, the young laird of Col, was now our
guide, and conducted us to Ostig, the residence of Mr. Martin
Macpherson, minister of Slate. There were great storms of wind and
rain which confined us to the house, but we were fully compensated
by Dr. Johnson's conversation.</p>

<p>We then returned to Armidale House, from whence we set sail for
Mull on October 3; but encountered during the night a dreadful
gale, which compelled the skipper to run his vessel to the Isle of
Col for shelter. We were detained in Col by storms till October 14,
when we safely crossed to Tobermorie, in the Island of Mull.</p>

<p>Ponies were provided for us, and we rode right across the
island, and then were ferried to the Island of Ulva, where we were
received by the laird, a very ancient chief, whose family has
possessed Ulva for nine hundred years. Next morning we took boat
for Inchkenneth, where we were introduced by Col to Sir Allan
Maclean, the chief of his clan, and his daughters.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, October 19, we took leave of the young ladies, and
of our excellent companion, Col. Sir Allan obligingly undertook to
accompany us to Icolmkill, and we proceeded thither in a boat with
four stout rowers, passing the great cave Gribon on the coast of
Mull, the island of Staffa, on which we could not land on account
of the high surge, and Nuns' Island. After a tedious sail, it gave
us no small pleasure to perceive a light in<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span> the village of
Icolmkill; and as we approached the shore, the tower of the
cathedral, just discernible in the moonlight, was a picturesque
object. When we had landed upon the sacred place, Dr. Johnson and I
cordially embraced.</p>

<p>I must own that Icolmkill did not answer my expectations, but
Dr. Johnson said it came up to his. We were both disappointed when
we were shown what are called the monuments of the kings of
Scotland, Ireland, and Denmark, and of a king of France. They are
only some gravestones flat on the earth, and we could see no
inscription. We set sail at midday for Mull, where we bade adieu to
our very kind conductor, Sir Allan Maclean, and crossed in the
ferry-boat to Oban, from whence next day we rode to Inverary.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Macaulay, one of the ministers of Inverary,
accompanied us to Inverary Castle, where I presented Dr. Johnson to
the Duke of Argyll. Dr. Johnson was much struck by the grandeur and
elegance of this princely seat. At dinner, the duchess was very
attentive to Dr. Johnson, who talked a great deal, and was so
entertaining that she placed her chair close to his, leaned upon
the back of it, and listened eagerly. Dr. Johnson was all attention
to her grace. From Inverary we passed to Rosedow, the beautiful
seat of Sir James Colquhoun, on the banks of the Loch Lomond, and
after passing a pleasant day boating round the loch and visiting
some of the islands, we proceeded to Cameron, the seat of
Commissary Smollett, from which we drove in a post-chaise to
Glasgow, inspecting by the way Dunbarton Castle.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;In the West of Scotland</i></div>

<p>During the day we spent in Glasgow, we were received in the
college by a number of the professors, who showed all due respect
to Dr. Johnson; and Dr. Leechman, Principal of the University, had
the satisfaction of telling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45"
id="Page_45">45</a></span> Dr. Johnson that his name had been
gratefully celebrated in the Highlands as the person to whose
influence it was chiefly owing that the New Testament was allowed
to be translated into the Erse language. On Saturday we set out
towards Ayrshire, and on November 2 reached my father's residence,
Auchinleck.</p>

<p>My father was not quite a year and a half older than Dr.
Johnson. His age, office, and character had long given him an
acknowledged claim to great attention in whatever company he was,
and he could ill brook any diminution of it. He was as sanguine a
Whig and Presbyterian as Dr. Johnson was a Tory and Church of
England man; and as he had not much leisure to be informed of Dr.
Johnson's great merits by reading his works, he had a partial and
unfavourable notion of him, founded on his supposed political
tenets, which were so discordant to his own that, instead of
speaking of him with that respect to which he was entitled, he used
to call him "a Jacobite fellow."</p>

<p>Knowing all this, I should not have ventured to bring them
together had not my father, out of kindness to me, desired me to
invite Dr. Johnson to his house. All went very smoothly till one
day they came into collision. If I recollect right, the contest
began while my father was showing him his collection of medals; and
Oliver Cromwell's coin unfortunately introduced Charles the First
and Toryism. They became exceedingly warm and violent; and in the
course of their altercation Whiggism and Presbyterism, Toryism and
Episcopacy were terribly buffeted. My father's opinion of Dr.
Johnson may be conjectured by the name he afterwards gave him,
which was "Ursa Major." However, on leaving Auchinleck, November 8,
for Edinburgh, my father, who had the dignified courtesy of an old
baron, was very civil to Dr. Johnson, and politely attended him to
the post-chaise. We arrived in Edinburgh on Tuesday night, November
9, after an absence of eighty-three days.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>My illustrious friend, being now desirous to be again in the
great theatre of life and animated exertion, took a place in the
coach, which was to set out for London, on Monday, November 22; but
I resolved that we should make a little circuit, as I would by no
means lose the pleasure of seeing <i>Sam</i> Johnson at the very
spot where <i>Ben</i> Jonson visited the learned and poetical
Drummond. Accordingly, we drove on the Saturday to Roslin Castle,
surveyed the romantic scene around it, and the beautiful Gothic
chapel. After that we proceeded to Hawthornden and viewed the
caves, and then drove on to Cranston, the seat of Sir John
Dalrymple, where we supped, spent the night, and passed on to the
inn at Blackshields. There on Monday morning Dr. Johnson joined the
coach for London. Dr. Johnson told me on parting that the time he
spent in Scotland, the account of which I have now completed, was
the pleasantest part of his life.</p>

<h4>JAMES BRUCE</h4>

<h4>Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The City of the Dog Star</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>James Bruce was born at the family residence of Kinnaird in the
county of Stirling, Scotland, on December 14, 1730. He was educated
at Harrow and Edinburgh, and for five years was a wine and spirit
merchant in London. In 1762 he went as British Consul to Algiers,
and did not return to England again until June, 1774. In the
interim, having travelled through Algiers, Tunis, Syria, some of
the islands of the Levant, Lower and Upper Egypt, and the African
and Arabian coasts of the Red Sea, he made his famous journeys in
Abyssinia, during which he discovered the sources of the Blue Nile.
On his return to Europe he met with a great reception from Buffon
the naturalist, and the Pope at Rome, but was received with
coldness in England, where the stories of his adventures were
received with incredulity. His book, "Travels to Discover the
Source of the Nile in the years 1768-73," did not appear till 1790,
seventeen years after his return to Europe. After the publication
of his great work, Bruce spent the remainder of his life in
improving his Scottish estate. On April 26, 1794, at Kinnaird, when
going downstairs to hand a lady guest to her carriage, his foot
slipped, and he fell headlong, dying next morning.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1762 Lord Halifax gave me the appointment of British Consul
at Algiers, as affording me the opportunity of exploring the
countries of Barbary, and perhaps of making, later on, a discovery
of the sources of the Nile. On arrival at Algiers I studied closely
surgery and medicine, modern Greek and Arabic, so as to qualify
myself to travel without an interpreter.</p>

<p>I remained in Algiers for three years, and started early in 1768
on my travels through that kingdom and Tunis, Crete and Rhodes,
Syria, Lower and Upper Egypt. Then I crossed the desert from
Assouan to Cosseir on the Red Sea, explored the Arabian Gulf, and
after visiting Jidda, arrived at Masuah [Massowah] on<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
September 19, 1769. Masuah, which means the "Harbour of the
Shepherds," is a small island close upon the Abyssinian shore, and
the governor is called the naybe. He himself was cruel, avaricious,
and a drunkard, but Achmet, his son, became my friend, as I had
cured him of an intermittent fever, and on November 10 he carried
me, my servants and baggage, from the island of Masuah to Arkeeko,
on the mainland, from which point my party started for the province
of Tigr&eacute;, in Abyssinia, on November 15.</p>

<p>For days we travelled across a gravelly plain, and then over
mountains, bare and full of terrible precipices with thickly wooded
intervening valleys, and on November 22 we descended into the town
of Dixan, in the province of Tigr&eacute;. It is inhabited by Moors
and Christians, and the only trade is that of selling children,
stolen or made captives in war, who are sent after purchase to
Arabia and India. The priests are openly concerned in this infamous
practice. We were frequently delayed by demands from local chiefs
for toll dues, and did not arrive at Adowa till December 6. This is
the residence of the governor of the province of
Tigr&eacute;&mdash;Michael Suhul, ras, or prime minister, of
Abyssinia. The mansion of the ras is situated on the top of a hill.
It resembles a prison rather than a palace, for there were in it
300 people confined in irons, the object being to extract money
from them. Some of them had been there for twenty years, and most
of them were kept in cages like wild beasts.</p>

<p>On January 17, 1770, we set out on our way to Gondar, and on the
following day reached the plain where the ruins of Axum, supposed
to be the ancient capital of Abyssinia, are situated. In one square
are forty obelisks of one piece of granite. A road is cut in the
mountain of red marble, having on the left a parapet wall about
five feet in height. At equal distances there are solid pedestals,
upon the tops of which stood originally<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span> colossal statues of
Sirius, Litrator Anubis, or Dog Star. There are 133 of these
pedestals, but only two much mutilated figures of the Dog remain.
There are also pedestals for figures of the Sphinx. Two magnificent
flights of steps several hundred feet long, all of granite, are the
only remains of the great Temple.</p>

<p>Within the site of the Temple is a small, mean modern church,
very ill kept. In it are what are supposed to be the Ark of the
Covenant and the copy of the law which Menilek, the son of Solomon
and the Queen of Sheba, is said in their fabulous history to have
been stolen from his father on his return from Jerusalem to
Ethiopia. These are reckoned the palladia of the country. Another
relic of great importance is a picture of the head of Christ
crowned with thorns, said to have been painted by Saint Luke. This
relic on occasions of war with pagans and Mohammedans is brought
out and carried with the army. Within the outer gate of the church
are three small enclosures with octagon pillars in the angles, on
the top of which were formerly images of the Dog Star. Upon a stone
in the middle of one of these enclosures the kings of the country
have been crowned since the days of paganism; and below it is a
large oblong slab of freestone, on which there is a Greek
inscription, the translation of which is "Of King Ptolemy
Euergetes, or the Beneficent."</p>

<p>We left Axum on January 20, and on the same day we saw three
travellers cutting three pieces of flesh, thicker and longer than
our ordinary beefsteaks, from the higher part of the buttock of a
cow. The beast was thrown on the ground, and one man held the head,
while two others were busy in cutting out the flesh.</p>

<p>I have been told that my friends have disbelieved this
statement. I pledge myself never to retract the fact here advanced,
that the Abyssinians do feed in common upon live flesh, and that I
myself for several years have been a partaker of that disagreeable
and beastly diet.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id=
"Page_50">50</a></span>Travelling pleasantly enough, though finding it difficult to get
food from the natives, we came on February 4 to the foot of Debra
Toon, one of the highest mountains of the romantic range of Hanza.
The toilsome ascent of Lamalmon, an extensive table-land of great
fertility, was begun on February 8, and on the 14th we arrived at
Gondar, the metropolis of Abyssinia.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Savage Native Practices</i></div>

<p>Gondar is situated on the flat summit of a hill of considerable
height, and consists of 10,000 families in time of peace. The
houses are chiefly of clay, with roofs thatched in the form of
cones. The king's palace is a square building on the west side of
the town, flanked with towers, and originally four stories high,
but now only two. The audience chamber is 120 feet long, and the
upper windows command a magnificent view of the great lake Tzana.
The palace and contiguous buildings are surrounded by a stone wall
30 feet high, 1½ miles in circumference. A little way from
Gondar to the north is Koscam, the palace of the itegh&eacute; and
the king's other wives. Tecla Haimanout was at this time king, and
Suhul Michael was ras, or prime minister. They were absent at the
time of my arrival.</p>

<p>Petros, an important Greek, who was the only one in Gondar to
whom I had recommendations, came in a state of great dread to me,
saying that he had seen at Michael's encampment, a few miles from
Gondar, the stuffed skin of an intimate friend of his own swinging
upon a tree, and drying in the wind beside the tent of the ras. The
itegh&eacute; and Ozoro Esther, wife of Ras Michael, sent for me to
the palace at Koscam to attend, as a medical man, the royal
families, because small-pox was then raging in the city and
surrounding districts. I saved the life of Ayto Confu, the
favourite son of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id=
"Page_51">51</a></span> Ozoro Esther, and others; and
thereafter became friends of the queen and her suite in the
palace.</p>

<p>I rode out on March 8 to meet Ras Michael at Azazo, the scene of
a great battle which had been fought with Fasil, a Galla chief, who
had broken out in rebellion. The first horrid spectacle exhibited
by him consisted of pulling out the eyes of twelve Galla chiefs,
who had been taken prisoners. They were then turned out into the
fields to be devoured by hyenas. Next day the army of 30,000 men
marched in triumph into Gondar. On March 14, I had an interview
with the ras, and he said that to prevent my being murdered for my
goods and instruments, and being bothered by the monks about
religious matters, the king, on his recommendation, had appointed
me baalomaal, the commander of the Koccob Horse.</p>

<p>In the course of the campaign between the king and his rebel
governors, I joined his majesty's forces, and on May 18, 1770, I
found myself at Dara, fourteen miles from the great cataract of the
Nile, which I obtained permission to visit. The shum, or head of
the people of the district, took me to a bridge, which consisted of
one arch of twenty-five feet in breadth, with the extremities
firmly based on solid rock on both sides. The Nile is here confined
between two rocks, and runs in a deep channel with great, roaring,
impetuous velocity. The cataract itself was the most magnificent
sight that ever I beheld. Its height is forty feet. The river had
been increased by the rains, and fell in one sheet of water half a
mile in breadth, with a noise that was truly terrible, and made me
for a time perfectly dizzy.</p>

<p>Returning to the king's army, I rode through a country of
smoking ruins and awful silence. The miserable natives, though
Christians, were being hunted to be sold into slavery to the Turks.
I found that the campaign was finished, and that we were to return
to Gondar, on reaching which, on May 30, Fasil returned to his
allegiance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span> Having successfully prescribed for Fasil's
principal general, the king was so pleased that he promised me any
favour. I asked the village of Geesh at the source of the Nile.
Whereupon the king said:</p>

<p>"I do give the village of Geesh and its fountains to Yagoube
(which was my name) and his posterity for ever, never to appear
under another name in the Deftar (land register), and never to be
taken from him, or exchanged in peace or war."</p>

<p>On June 5 the king and Michael retired to Tigr&eacute;; Gusho
and Powussen&mdash;two of the rebel governors&mdash;entered Gondar
in triumph, and proclaimed a young man, reputed to be the son of
Yasous II., who died in 1753, king under the name of Socinios. I
remained at Gondar unmolested until October 28, 1770, when I
determined to make an attempt to reach the head of the Nile, and
with my followers and instruments marched through the country of
the Aroussi, much the most pleasant territory in Abyssinia, being
finely shaded with forests of the Acacia Vera, the tree which
produces the gum arabic. Below these trees grew wild oats of
prodigious height and size. I often made the grain into cakes in
remembrance of Scotland.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;At the Source of the
Nile</i></div>

<p>After passing the Assar River, going in a south-east direction,
we had for the first time a distinct view of the high mountain of
Geesh, the long-wished-for end of our dangerous and troublesome
journey. This was on November 2, 1770, and on the following day we
rode through a marshy plain in which the Nile winds more in the
space of four miles than I believe any river in the world. It is
not here more than 20 feet broad and one deep. After this, we
pushed forward to a terrible range of mountains, in which is
situated the village of Geesh, where are the long-expected
fountains of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=
"Page_53">53</a></span> Nile. These mountains are disposed one
range behind the other, nearly in the form of arcs, and three
concentrate circles, which seems to suggest the idea that they are
the Montes Lun&aelig; of antiquity, or the Mountains of the Moon,
at the foot of which the Nile was said to rise. The highest,
Amid-Amid, does not exceed half a mile in height. Crossing the
mountains, we had a distinct view of the territory of Sacala, the
mountain of Geesh, and the church of St. Michael.</p>

<p>Immediately below us was the Nile itself, now a mere brook, with
scarcely water enough in it to turn a mill. I could not satiate
myself with the sight, revolving in my mind all those classic
prophecies that had given the Nile up to perpetual obscurity and
concealment. I ran down the hill towards a little island of green
sods, and I stood in rapture over the principal fountain of the
Nile, which rises in the middle of it. This was November 4,
1770.</p>

<p>It is easier to imagine than to describe the situation of my
mind at that moment, standing on that spot which had baffled the
genius, industry and inquiry of both ancients and moderns over a
course of nearly 3,000 years. Though a mere private Briton, I
triumphed here in my own mind over kings and their armies.</p>

<p>The Agows of Damot pay divine honours to the Nile, sacrificing
multitudes of cattle to the spirit which is supposed to reside at
its source. From the edge of the cliff at Geesh the ground slopes
to the marsh, in whose centre is a hillock, which is the altar on
which the religious ceremonies of the Agows are performed. A
shallow trench surrounds it, and collects the water which flows
from a hole in the middle of the hillock, three feet in diameter
and six feet in depth. This is the principal fountain of the
Nile.</p>

<p>Ten feet from this spring is a second fountain, about eleven
inches in diameter and eight feet deep; and at twenty feet distance
there is a third, two feet in diameter<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span> and six feet in
depth. Both of these are enclosed, like the first, by an altar of
turf. The water from all these joins and flows eastward in
quantities sufficient to fill a pipe of about two inches in
diameter.</p>

<p>I made no fewer than thirty-five observations with the view of
determining with the utmost precision the latitude of the fountains
of the Nile, and I found the mean result to be 10&deg; 59' 25"
north latitude. Equally careful observations proved them to be
36&deg; 55' 30" east longitude. The mercury in the barometer
indicated a height above the sea of more than two miles. The Shum
of Geesh, whose title is kefla abay, "the Servant of the Nile,"
told me that the Agows called the river "The Everlasting God, Light
of the World, Eye of the World, God of Peace, Saviour, Father of
the Universe."</p>

<p>Once a year, on the first appearance of the Dog Star, the kefla
abay assembles all the heads of the clans at the principal altar,
where a black heifer that never bore a calf is sacrificed. The
carcase, which is washed all over with Nile water, is divided among
the different tribes, and eaten on the spot, raw, and with Nile
water. The bones are burned to ashes, and the head, wrapped in the
skin, is carried into a huge cave. On November 9 I traced on foot
the whole course of the river to the plain of Guotto, and next day
we left Geesh on our return to Gondar, which was reached on the
19th.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Return to Egypt</i></div>

<p>Shortly afterwards Socinios, the usurping king, fled on the
approach of King Tecla and Ras Michael with 20,000 men. On their
entry into the city, those who had sympathised with the usurper
were executed in hundreds with a wanton cruelty which shocked and
disgusted me. The bodies of the victims were cut in pieces and
scattered about the streets, and hundreds of hyenas came down from
the neighbouring mountains to feed on<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> the human carrion. I
determined to do the best I could to escape from this bloody
country, but was constrained to take a part in the civil war, and
commanded a force of heavy cavalry in King Tecla's army in the
three battles of Serbraxos. My performances so pleased the king
that he decorated me with a heavy gold chain containing 184 links.
The upshot of the campaign was that Michael was banished to
Begender and the former rebel Gusho appointed ras in his place.</p>

<p>After many delays I was allowed to depart for Egypt on September
28, 1771, and, passing through the Shangalla country, I reached, on
January 2, 1772, the enchanted mountain country of Tcherkin, which
abounded in game&mdash;elephants, rhinoceroses, buffaloes, etc.
Here they have an extraordinary way of hunting the elephant by
severing the tendon above the heel of the hind leg with a sharp
sword. At Hor Cacamoot, which means the Valley of the Shadow of
Death, I was on January 20 attacked with dysentery, and compelled
to remain there until March 17. Many hardships were endured and
servants lost in a simoom which overtook us in the march to the
Atbara, and after numerous adventures in the country of the
Nubas&mdash;pagans, negroids, worshippers of the moon&mdash;I
arrived on April 29 at Sennaar, where I was compelled to remain
four months.</p>

<p>Summoned to wait upon the king, I found him in a clay-built
palace covering a very extensive area, and of one story. The dress
of the king was simply a loose shirt of Surat blue cotton cloth. I
was asked to treat medically the three principal queens. The
favourite was six feet high, and corpulent beyond all proportion.
She seemed to me, next the elephant and the rhinoceros, to be the
largest living creature I had ever met. A ring of gold passed
through her upper lip and weighed it down like a flap to cover her
chin. Her ears reached to her shoulders, and had the appearance of
wings. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span> each was a large ring of gold; she had a gold
necklace of several rows, and her ankles bore manacles of gold.</p>

<p>At Sennaar the Nile gets its name of Babar El Azergue, the Blue
River. The meat diet of the upper classes is beef, partly roasted
and partly raw. That of the common people is camel's flesh, the
liver and spare-rib of which are eaten raw. During my stay here I
was compelled to part with all but six of the 184 links of the gold
chain which I received from the king of Abyssinia, to pay for
supplies, and I was glad when permitted to depart on September 2,
1772.</p>

<p>On October 26 we arrived at Gooz, the capital of Barbar. There
we made preparations to cross the great desert, beginning the
journey on November 9. One day we saw twenty moving pillars of
sand. On another occasion we met the simoom, the purple haze in
rushing past threatening suffocation. Many of the wells had dried
up, our water and our provisions became exhausted, our camels died,
all of the party suffered from thirst and fever, and on November
25, in order to save our lives, we abandoned my valuable papers,
quadrant, telescopes, and other instruments, at Saffieha.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we got a view of a range of hills marking
the course of the Nile. In the evening we heard the noise of water,
and saw a flock of birds. Christians, Moors, and Turks all burst
into tears, embracing one another and thanking God for our
deliverance. That night we encamped at Seielut, and next morning we
came on foot to Assouan. With one accord we ran to the Nile to
drink. I sat down under the shade of a palm and fell into a
profound sleep. We were received heartily by the aga, and after
resting five or six days to recover, we retraced our steps to
Saffieha, and I had the satisfaction of recovering all my baggage.
On December 11 we left Assouan, and sailed down the Nile for Cairo,
where we arrived on January 10, 1773.</p>

<h4>JOHN LEWIS BURCKHARDT</h4>

<h4>Travels in Nubia</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;On the Eastern Bank of the
Nile</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>John Lewis Burckhardt was born at Lausanne, Switzerland, Nov.
24, 1784. He declined a diplomatic appointment in Germany, and came
to England in 1806, bringing with him letters of introduction to
Sir Joseph Banks, from Professor Blumenbach, the celebrated
naturalist of G&ouml;ttingen. He tendered his services as an
explorer to the Association for Promoting the Discovery of the
Interior Parts of Africa. His offer was accepted, and Burckhardt
left England on March 2, 1809, and proceeded to Syria, where,
disguised as an Indian Mohammedan merchant, he spent two and a half
years, learning among Arab tribes different dialects of Arabic. In
1812, he went to Egypt, intending to join a caravan for Fezzan in
order to explore the sources of the Niger; but, being frustrated in
that, he made his two expeditions into Nubia which form the subject
of the present epitome. In June, 1815, he returned to Cairo, and
prepared his journals for publication. After making a tour to Suez
and Sinai in 1816, he was suddenly cut off by dysentery in Cairo on
October 15, 1817. Although he did not learn English until he was
twenty-four years of age, Burckhardt's journals are written with
remarkable spirit, more especially considering that his notes had
all to be taken secretly.</p>
</div>

<p>I left Assouan on February 24, 1813, to make my journey through
Nubia. Assouan is the most romantic spot in Egypt, but little
deserving the lofty praise which some travellers have bestowed upon
it for its antiquities and those of the neighbouring island of
Elephantine. I carried with me nothing but my gun, sabre, and
pistol, a provision bag, and a woollen mantle, which served either
for a carpet or a covering during the night. I was dressed in the
blue gown of the merchants of Upper Egypt. After estimating the
expense I was likely to incur in Nubia, I put eight Spanish dollars
into my purse in conformity with the principle I have consistently
acted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span> upon during my travels&mdash;viz., that the less the
traveller spends while on the march, and the less money he carries
with him, the less likely are his travelling projects to
miscarry.</p>

<p>After crossing the mountain opposite Phil&aelig;, I passed the
night in the house of a sheikh at Wady Debot, where I first tasted
the country dish which during my journey became my constant
food&mdash;viz., thin unleavened and slightly-baked cakes of
dhourra, served with sweet or sour milk. From here to Dehmyt, the
grand chain of mountains on the east side of the Nile is
uninterrupted; but from the latter place to the second cataract,
beyond Wady Halfa, the mountains are of sandstone, except some
granite rocks above Talfa. The shore widens at Korosko, and groves
of date-trees adorn the banks all the way past Derr to Ibrim. The
rich deposit of the river on the eastern bank yields large crops of
dhourra and cotton. It is different on the western shore, where the
desert sands, blown by the north-west winds, are swept up to the
very brink of the river.</p>

<p>It is near Derr that occurs the most ancient known temple,
entirely hewn out of the sandstone rock. The gods of Egypt seemed
to have been worshipped here long before they were lodged in the
gigantic temples of Karnac and Gorne. At Ibrim there is an aga,
independent of the governors of Nubia, and the inhabitants pay no
taxes. They are descendants of Bosnian soldiers who were sent by
the great Sultan Selym to garrison the castle of Ibrim, now a ruin,
against the Mamelouks. In no parts of the Eastern world have I ever
found property in such perfect security as in Ibrim. The Ababde
Arabs between Derr and Dongola are very poor. They pride themselves
on the purity of their race and the beauty of their women, and
refuse to intermarry with the Nubians.</p>

<p>Beyond Wady Halfa is the second cataract, and the foaming waters
dashing against the black-and-green<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span> rocks, or forming quiet
pools and lakes, so that the Nile expands to two miles in breadth,
is a most impressive sight. The rapids render navigation impossible
between here and Sukkot, a distance of a hundred miles, and the
river is hemmed in sometimes by high banks, as at Mershed, where I
could throw a stone over to the opposite side. The rock, which had
been sandstone hitherto, changes its nature at the second cataract
to granite and quartz.</p>

<p>At Djebel Lamoule, which we reached on March 9, we had to follow
a mountain track, and, on approaching the river again, the Arab who
acted as guide tried to extract from me a present by collecting a
heap of sand, and placing a stone at each extremity to indicate
that a traveller's tomb is made. I immediately alighted from my
camel, and began to make another tomb, telling him that it was
intended for his own sepulchre, for, as we were brethren, it was
but just that we should be buried together. At this he began to
laugh. We mutually destroyed each other's labour, and in riding
along he exclaimed from the Koran: "No mortal knows the spot on
earth where his grave shall be digged." In the plain of Aamara,
which begins the district of Say, there is a fine Egyptian temple,
the six columns of which are of calcareous stone&mdash;the only
specimen of that material to be met with, those in Egypt being all
sandstone.</p>

<p>On March 13 we reached the territory of Mahass, and at the
castle of Tinareh I visited the camp of Mohammed Kashefs, a
Mamelouk chief who had captured the castle from a rebel cousin of
the Mahass king. He behaved like a madman, got very drunk on palm
wine, and threatened to cut off my head on suspicion of my being an
agent of the pasha of Egypt, who was the enemy of the Mamelouks.
Had it not been for the arrival of the nephew of the governor of
Sukkot, the threat would in all probability have been carried into
execution.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span><i>II.&mdash;Discoveries in Egyptian
Temples</i></div>

<p>On March 15 my guide and I escaped from the Mamelouk's camp, and
at Kolb&eacute; crossed to the west side of the river by swimming
at the tail of our camels, each beast having an inflated goatskin
tied to its neck. I thought it wise to return down the Nile to
Assouan, and we pushed on as hard as our camels could proceed.
Passing the cataracts at Wady Samme and Wady Halfa, we came to Wady
Fereyg, where there is a mountain on both sides of the Nile. At the
bottom of that, on the west side, is a hitherto undiscovered temple
named Ebsambal. The temple stands about twenty feet above the
surface of the water, entirely cut out of the almost perpendicular
rocky side of the mountain, and is in complete preservation. In
front of the entrance are six erect colossal figures representing
juvenile persons, three on each side of the entrance, in narrow
recesses. Their height from the ground to the knee is about 6½
feet. The spaces of the smooth rock between the niches are covered
with hieroglyphics, as are also the walls of the interior. The
statues represent Osiris, Isis, and a youth, and each has small
figures beside it four feet high.</p>

<p>I was about to climb the mountain to rejoin my guide and the
camels, when I fell in with what is yet visible of four immense
colossal statues cut out of the rock at a distance of 200 yards
from the temple. They stand in a deep recess excavated in the
mountain, and are almost entirely buried beneath the sands, which
are blown down here in torrents. The entire head and part of the
breast and arms of one of the statues are yet above the surface.
The head has a most expressive youthful countenance, approaching
nearer to the Grecian model of beauty than that of any ancient
Egyptian figure I have seen. Indeed, were it not for a thin, oblong
beard, it would pass for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61"
id="Page_61">61</a></span> head of Pallas. This statue
measures seven yards across the shoulders, and could not, if in an
upright posture, be less than sixty-five or seventy feet in height.
The ear is one yard and four inches in length.</p>

<p>On the wall of the rock in the centre of the four statues is a
figure of the hawk-headed Osiris, surmounted by a globe; beyond
which, I suspect, could the sand be cleared away, a vast temple
would be discovered, to the entrance of which the colossal figures
serve as ornaments. I should pronounce these works to belong to the
finest period of Egyptian sculpture, and that the hieroglyphics are
of the same age as those on the temple of Derr.</p>

<p>I continued my journey along the west bank of the Nile, and in
the course of several days inspected the ruins of all the known
ancient temples and early Greek churches. Summing up my impressions
of the temples, I would say that we find in Nubia specimens of all
the different eras of Egyptian architecture and history, which
indeed can only be traced in Nubia; for all the remaining temples
in Egypt, that of Gorne, perhaps, excepted, appear to have been
erected in an age when the science of architecture had nearly
attained to perfection.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Across the Nubian
Desert</i></div>

<p>I reached Assouan on March 30, after an absence of thirty-five
days, having travelled at the rate of ten hours each day. On April
9, I proceeded to Esn&eacute;, which I had made my headquarters in
Upper Egypt.</p>

<p>I remained at Esn&eacute; till the spring of 1814, waiting for
an opportunity to start with a caravan of slave-traders towards the
interior parts of Nubia in a more easterly direction than I had
been in my journey towards Dongola. At the end of February I heard
that a caravan was on the point of starting from Daraou, three
days' journey north of Esn&eacute;, for the confines of Sennaar,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">
62</a></span> I determined to accompany it and try my fortune on
this new route without any servant and in the garb of a poor
trader.</p>

<p>The start was made on March 2, 1814, and from the first day of
our departure my companions treated me with neglect, and even with
contempt. Although they had no idea I was a Frank, they imagined
that I was of Turkish origin, an opinion sufficient to excite the
ill-treatment of Arabs, who bear the most inveterate hatred to the
Osmanli. From the small quantity of merchandise I had, they
considered I was a trader running away from my creditors, but I
succeeded in convincing them that I was travelling in search of a
lost cousin who had made an expedition to Darfour and Sennaar in
Nubia, in which the whole of my property was engaged.</p>

<p>At Wady el Nabeh, the wells of which have a great repute all
through Nubia, and which we reached on March 14, we met a band of
Ababdes driving thirty slaves before them, which they were taking
to sell in Egypt. In general, I found the dreaded Nubian
deserts&mdash;as far as Shigr&eacute;, at least, which we reached
on March 16 with difficulty, on account of shortage of
water&mdash;of much less dreary appearance than the great Syrian
desert, and still less so than the desert of Suez and Tyh. The high
mountains of Shigr&eacute; consist of huge blocks of granite heaped
upon one another in the wildest confusion.</p>

<p>During the whole march we were surrounded on all sides by lakes
of mirage, called by the Arabs "serab." Its colour was of the
purest azure, and so clear that the shadows of the mountains which
bordered the horizon were reflected on it with the greatest
precision, and the delusion of its being a sheet of water was thus
rendered still more perfect. We experienced great suffering from
the reckless waste of water and the dryness of the wells which were
expected to yield supplies; and so serious did it become that
twelve of the strongest of the camels<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span> were selected to hasten
forward to fetch a supply of water from the nearest part of the
Nile. They returned the following morning from their desperate
mission, bringing with them plentiful supplies of the delicious
water of the Nile, in which we revelled, enabling us to reach
Berber on March 23, the whole desert journey having taken us
twenty-two days.</p>

<p>The governor of Berber, which consists of four villages, is
called the mek, and is nominated by the king of Sennaar. He,
however, exercises a feeble authority over the Arabs. The people of
Berber are a handsome race. The men are taller, larger-limbed, and
stronger than the Egyptians, and red-brown in colour. The features
are not those of the negro, the face being oval, and the nose
perfectly Grecian. They say, "We are Arabs, not negroes." The
practice of drunkenness and debauchery is universal, and everything
discreditable to humanity is found in their character.</p>

<p>I remained a fortnight in Berber, and on April 7 our caravan,
reduced to two-thirds of its original numbers, set out for Shendy.
Three days afterwards we came to Damer, a town of 500 houses, neat
and clean, with regular tree-shaded streets. The inhabitants are
Arabs of the tribe of Medja-ydin, and the greater part of them are
Fokera, or religious men. They have a pontiff called El Faky El
Kebir (the great faky), who is their chief and judge. In the mosque
there is a famous school attended by young men from Darfour,
Sennaar, Kordofan, and other parts of the Soudan; and the affairs
of this little hierarchical state appeared to be conducted with
great prudence. From Damer we passed on to Shendy, where we arrived
on April 18.</p>

<p>This is a place of 1,000 houses, and the present mek owns large
salt-works near the town, where the ground is largely impregnated
with salt. Merchants from Sennaar buy up the salt and trade it as
far as Abyssinia. Next to Sennaar and Cobb&eacute; in Darfour,
Shendy is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id=
"Page_64">64</a></span> largest town in the Eastern Soudan.
Debauchery and drunkenness are as fashionable here as in Berber.
The people are better dressed, and the women have rings of gold in
their noses and ears. Shendy is the centre of considerable trade,
but its principal market is for slaves, who are chiefly negroes,
stolen from the interior.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian slave-women are reckoned the best and most
faithful of all, and are bought for the harems of the Arab chiefs.
As to the slave-traffic as a whole, laudable as the efforts of
England have been to abolish this infamous trade in Western and
South-western Africa, there does not appear to be the smallest hope
of the abolition of slavery in Africa itself. It is not from
foreign nations that the blacks can hope for deliverance. This
great work must be effected by themselves, and this can only be
done by the education of the sons of Africa in their own country
and by their own countrymen.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Among Savage Arab Tribes</i></div>

<p>In the caravan for Souakin, which left Shendy on May 17, I
joined myself as a poor man to a party of black traders from
Western Africa. After five days spent in traversing sandy and
gravelly plains, we came to the Atbara river, which has a greater
variety of natural vegetation than I had seen anywhere on the banks
of the Nile in Egypt. Having crossed the Atbara, our route lay to
the S.E., and we soon entered the country of the Bisharein
Arabs&mdash;a bold and handsome race.</p>

<p>The moral character of both sexes is wholly bad. They are
treacherous, cruel, avaricious, and revengeful, and are restrained
in the indulgence of their passions by no laws either human or
divine. However, they have a dread, especially the women, of a
white man, and the latter shriek at the sight of what they consider
an out-cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">
65</a></span> of nature, saying, "God preserve us from the
devil." On May 31 the caravan broke into two parts, one taking the
direct road through the desert to Souakin, the other proceeding by
Taka; and I determined to accompany the latter. We followed the
course of the Atbara, and, after crossing stretches of the desert,
came, on June 3, to the village of Goz Radjeb, the centre of the
country of the Hadendoa, a tribe of the Bisharein. A Hadendoa
seldom scruples to kill his companion on the road in order to
possess himself of the most trifling article of value, but a
retaliation of blood exists in full force. They are not given to
hospitality, as other Arabs are, and they boast of their treachery.
On June 6, we came to the district of Taka, fertile and populous
owing to the regular inundation of the Atbara and its tributaries.
A valley in the eastern mountains is noted for its splendid breed
of cattle and fine dhourra. The Bisharein here eat the blood of
animals coagulated over the fire, and the liver and kidneys
raw.</p>

<p>In an adjoining valley we encountered another tribe of Bisharein
called the Hallenga, who draw their origin from Abyssinia. They
have a horrible custom in connection with the revenge of blood.
When the slayer has been seized by the relatives of the deceased, a
family feast is proclaimed, at which the murderer is brought into
the midst of them, bound upon an angareyg, and while his throat is
slowly cut with a razor, the blood is caught in a bowl and handed
round amongst the guests, every one of whom is bound to drink of it
at the moment the victim breathes his last.</p>

<p>A stay was made at Filik, the principal town of Taka, till June
15, when the caravan struck N.E. by N., and marched alternately
through sandy and fertile country, across mountains of no great
height, and plains with herds of ostriches and fine cattle. The low
grounds were frequently intersected by the beds of torrential
streams. One day, we crossed a rocky plain with the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span> soil
strongly impregnated with salt, and pastured by large herds of
camels which the Arabs here keep for their milk and flesh alone,
seldom using them as beasts of burden.</p>

<p>On June 26 we arrived at El Geyf, an environ of
Souakin&mdash;the town itself, which consists of 600 houses, being
on one of the islands in the bay of Souakin. The inhabitants of
Souakin are a motley race, and are governed by the Emir el
Hadherebe, a chief of the Bisharein tribe on the neighbouring
mainland, who is chosen by the five first families of the tribe,
but is nominally dependent upon the pasha of Djidda.</p>

<p>The manners of the people partake of the vices of their
neighbours in the desert, and in cruelty surpass them, and the law
of the strongest is alone respected. I was ill-treated by the aga,
the representative of the Turkish Government, until I produced the
firmans which I had concealed in a secret pocket, given me by
Mohammed Aly, the viceroy of Egypt, and by Ibrahim Pasha, his son.
When the aga saw these with their handsome seals, he regarded me as
a great personage; but I refused to take up my abode in his house,
which hospitality he offered, and continued to live in the camp of
the black merchants on the mainland.</p>

<p>I had intended proceeding to Mokha by ship and then on to Sana,
the capital of the Yemen, from which place to make the pilgrimage
to Mekka. However, having heard of the war in the Hedjaz in Arabia,
I abandoned my project, and sailed from Souakin, on July 6, for
Djidda, where I arrived on July 16, and afterwards joined Mohammed
Aly.</p>

<h4>SIR RICHARD BURTON</h4>

<h4>Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The Pilgrim Ship</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sir Richard F. Burton, K.C.M.G., was born at Barham House,
Hertfordshire, England, March 19, 1821. He was intended for the
Church, and spent a year at Oxford; but showed no clerical
leanings, and found a more congenial profession when he obtained a
cadetship in the Indian Army in 1842. During the next few years he
acquired an extraordinary knowledge of Mohammedan usages and
languages that was afterwards to serve him in good stead. In 1849
he returned to England; in 1851 published three books on Indian
subjects, and in April, 1853, set forth on his cherished and daring
project of visiting in disguise the sacred cities of Islam. The
voyage was a particularly dangerous one, Burton frequently having
to defend his life, though in so doing he never took another life
during the whole of the journey. The account of his "Pilgrimage to
El Medinah and Meccah" was published in 1855. Afterwards he
travelled in Somaliland, Central Africa, North and South America,
and elsewhere, and unfailingly published books on his journeys. He
died at Trieste on October 20, 1890.</p>
</div>

<p>Early in the morning of April 4, 1853, a "Persian prince"
embarked at Southampton for Alexandria. The "prince" was myself,
about to undertake a journey for the purpose of removing that
opprobrium to modern adventure, the huge white blot which on our
maps still notes the eastern regions of Arabia. I had hoped to make
a more extended tour, but the East India Company had only granted
me a year's furlough, refusing the three years that I had asked on
the ground that my project was too dangerous. The attempt was one
that could not be made save in Mohammedan disguise, and in order to
conceal my identity effectively, I had thought it prudent to assume
this disguise ere leaving England. I<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span> as amply supplied with
funds by the Royal Geographical Society.</p>

<p>Several months were spent by me at Alexandria and Cairo in
thoroughly familiarising myself once again with Moslem tongues and
usages, partly forgotten during a four years' stay in the West. I
diligently studied the Koran, and became an adept at Mohammedan
religious practices; and my knowledge of medicine, by enabling me
to set up as a doctor, brought me into the close contact with all
classes of Moslems that I required for my purpose. I soon dropped
the character of a Persian for that of a wandering dervish; but
afterwards a still more convenient disguise occurred to me, and I
visited El Medinah and Meccah as an Afghan Pathan who had been
educated at Rangoon.</p>

<p>Pilgrims to the holy shrines arriving at Alexandria are divided
into bodies, and distributed to the three great roads, namely,
Suez, Cosseir, and the Haj route by land round the Gulf of Akabah.
My route was by Suez, and at Suez I and my fellow-pilgrims had a
long wait for a vessel to convey us to Yambu, the port of
disembarkation for El Medinah. During this wait I had vexatious
difficulties over my passport, which were only solved by an appeal
to the British consul.</p>

<p>I must now briefly describe the party into which fate threw me.
First of all comes Omar Effendi, a plump and beardless Circassian,
of yellow complexion and bilious temperament; he dresses
respectably, pays regularly, hates the fair sex, has a mild
demeanour, but when roused becomes furious as a tiger. His
confidential negro servant, Saad, known as the Devil, was born and
bred a slave, obtained manumission, and has wandered as far afield
as Russia and Gibraltar. He is the pure African, merry at one
moment and sulky at another, affectionate and abusive, reckless and
crafty, quarrelsome and unscrupulous to the last degree.</p>

<p>Shaykh Hamid el Lamman, of El Medinah, is a perfect<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
specimen of the town Arab&mdash;his face a dirty brown, his beard
untrimmed, his only garment, an ochre-coloured blouse, exceedingly
unclean. He can sing, slaughter a sheep, deliver a grand call to
prayer, shave, cook, fight, and vituperate. Salih Shakkar is a Turk
on his father's side, an Arab on his mother's; he is as avaricious
as an Arab, and as supercilious as a Turk. All these people
borrowed money from me. To their number must be added Mohammed, a
hot-headed Meccan youth, whom I had met in Cairo, and who appointed
himself my companion; and Shaykh Nur, my Indian servant.</p>

<p>Through the activity of Saad the Devil&mdash;not disinterested
activity, for he wanted to pay nothing himself and to make us pay
too much&mdash;we were at last able to book passages on the vessel
Golden Thread. Amid infinite clamour and excitement on a hot July
morning we boarded her, only to be threatened with loss of our
places on the poop by a rush of Maghrabi pilgrims, men from Western
Africa, desperately poor and desperately violent. Saad the Devil
disposed of the intruders by the simple process of throwing them
into the hold. There the Maghrabis fell out with a few Turks, and
in a few minutes nothing was to be seen but a confused mass of
humanity, each item indiscriminately scratching, biting, punching,
and butting.</p>

<p>A deputation of us waited upon Ali Murad, the owner, to inform
him of the crowded state of the vessel. He told us to be good, and
not fight; to trust in Allah, and that Allah would make all things
easy for us. His departure was the signal for a second fray. This
time the Maghrabis swarmed towards the poop like angry hornets;
Saad provided us with a bundle of long ashen staves, and we laid on
with might and main. At length it occurred to me to roll an earthen
jar full of water&mdash;weighing about a hundred pounds&mdash;upon
the assailants. After this they shrank back and offered peace.</p>

<p>It was twelve days before we reached Yambu. The<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span> vessel
had no compass, no log, no sounding-line, nor even the suspicion of
a chart. Each night we anchored, usually in one of the many inlets
of the Arabian coast, and when possible we went ashore. The heat
during the day was insufferable, the wind like the blast of a
lime-kiln; we lay helpless and half senseless, without appetite and
without energy, feeling as if a few more degrees of heat would be
death. Nothing, on the other hand, could have been more delicious
than the hour of sunrise. The air was mild and balmy as that of an
Italian spring; the mountains, grim and bare during full daylight,
mingled their summits with the jasper tints of the sky; at their
base ran a sea of amethyst. Not less lovely was the sunset, but
after a quarter of an hour its beauty faded, and the wilderness of
white crags and pinnacles was naked and ghastly under the moon.</p>

<p>On arriving at Yambu we had to treat for camels, and make
provision for the seven days' journey to El Medinah. As I had
injured my foot on the voyage, I bought a shugduf or litter, a
vehicle appropriated to women and infirm persons; it had the
advantage that notes were more easily taken in it than on a
dromedary's back. At 7 p.m. on July 18 we passed through the gate
of Yambu, and took a course due east. My companions, as Arabs will
do on such occasions, began to sing.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;In the Footsteps of
Mohammed</i></div>

<p>Our little party consisted of twelve camels, and we travelled in
Indian file, head tied to tail, with but one outrider, Omar
Effendi, whose rank required him to mount a dromedary with showy
trappings. In two hours we began to pass over undulating ground
with a perceptible rise. At three in the morning we reached the
halting-place and lay down to sleep; at nine we breakfasted off a
biscuit, a little rice, and milkless tea, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span> slept
again. Dinner, consisting chiefly of boiled rice with clarified
butter, was at two; and at three we were ready to start. Towards
sunset there was a cry of thieves, which created vast confusion;
but the thieves were only half a dozen in number, and fled when a
few bullets were sent in their direction.</p>

<p>Next day we travelled through a country fantastic in its
desolation&mdash;a mass of huge hills, barren plains, and desert
vales. The third day was spent uncomfortably at El Hamra, a
miserable collection of hovels made of unbaked brick and mud. It
was reported that Saad, the great robber-chief, was in the field,
and there was consequently danger that our march would be delayed.
The power of this ruffian is a standing proof of the imbecility of
the Turkish Government.</p>

<p>The Holy Land of El Hejaz drains off Turkish gold and blood in
abundance, and the lords of the country hold in it a contemptible
position. If they catch a thief, they dare not hang him. They must
pay blackmail, and yet be shot at in every pass. They affect
superiority over the Arabs, hate them, and are despised by them.
Happily, we were overtaken at El Hamra by a Meccan caravan which
had influence to procure a military escort; so we were able to
proceed, with no serious hindrance, to Bir Abbas.</p>

<p>In the evening of our first melancholy day at this hot, sandy,
barren spot, firearms were heard in the distance, betokening an
engagement between the troops and the Bedouins. It was not until
the following night that we were allowed to start. At dawn we
entered an ill-famed gorge called the Pilgrims' Pass. Presently,
thin blue curls of smoke rose from the cliffs on the left, and
there rang out the sharp cracks of the hillmen's matchlocks. From
their perches on the rocks they fired upon us with perfect comfort
and no danger to themselves, aiming chiefly at our Albanian escort.
We had nothing to do but blaze away as much powder, and veil
ourselves in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
"Page_72">72</a></span> as much smoke as possible; we lost
twelve men in the affair, besides several of the animals.</p>

<p>We journeyed on through desolate mountain country, all of my
companions in the worst of tempers. I spent a whole day trying to
recover from Saad the Devil the money I had lent him at Suez.
Ultimately, he flung the money down before me without a word. But I
had been right in my persistence; had I not forced him to repay me
he would have asked for more. At last, after an abominably bad
night's travelling, we climbed up a flight of huge steps cut in
black basalt. My companions pressed on eagerly, speaking not a
word. We passed through a lane of black scoria, with steep banks on
both sides.</p>

<p>"O, Allah! This is the sanctuary of the Prophet! O open the
gates of Thy mercy!" "O, Allah! Bless the last of Prophets with
blessings in number as the stars of heaven!" "Live for ever, O most
excellent of Prophets!" Such were the exclamations that burst from
our party as the Holy City, the burial place of Mohammed, lay
before us in its fertile girdle of gardens and orchards.</p>

<p>At our feet was a spacious plain, bounded in front by undulating
ground; on the left by the grim rocks of Mount Ohod; on the right
by the gardens of Kuba. On the north-west of the town wall was a
tall white-washed fort, partly built upon rock. In the suburb El
Munakhah, near at hand, rose the brand-new domes and minarets of
the five mosques. Farther away to the east could be seen the gem of
El Medinah, the four tall towers, and the flashing green dome under
which rest the Prophet's remains.</p>

<p>We proceeded towards the gate, from which an eager multitude
poured forth to greet friends in the caravan. I took my abode with
Shaykh Hamid, who abandoned his former dirt and shabbiness and
appeared clean, well-dressed, and with neatly trimmed moustache and
beard. He was to pilot me through the intricate ceremonies of<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the visits to the Prophet's tomb and the other holy places, and in
the evening I set out with him for the Haram, or sanctuary of the
Prophet.</p>

<p>The Prophet's mosque at El Medinah is the second of the three
most venerable places in the world, according to Islamic belief; it
is peculiarly connected with Mohammed, as Meccah is with Abraham,
and Jerusalem with Solomon. On entering it, I was astonished at the
mean and tawdry appearance of a place so venerated in the Moslem
world. There is no simple grandeur about it, as there is about the
Kaabah at Meccah; rather does it suggest a museum of second-rate
art, decorated with but pauper splendour. The mosque is a
parallelogram about 420 feet in length by 340 broad, and the main
colonnade in the south of the building, called El Rawzah (the
garden), contains all that is venerable. Shaykh Hamid and I fought
our way in through a crowd of beggars with our hands behind us, and
beginning with the right feet, we advanced towards the holy places.
After preliminary prayers at the Prophet's pulpit, we reached the
mausoleum, an irregular square in the south-east corner, surrounded
by walls and a fence. Three small windows enable one to peer at the
three tombs within&mdash;Mohammed's, Abubekr's, and Omar's. After
long praying I was permitted to look through the window opposite
the Prophet's tomb. I could see nothing but a curtain with
inscriptions, and a large pearl rosary denoting the exact position
of the tomb. Many other sacred spots had to be visited, and many
other prayers uttered, ere we left the building.</p>

<p>The principal places of pious visitation in the vicinity of El
Medinah are the mosques of Kuba, the cemetery El Bakia, and the
martyr Hamzah's tomb at the foot of Mount Ohod, the scene of one of
Mohammed's most famous battles. The mosques of Kuba are the
pleasantest to visit, lying as they do among the date-palm
plantations, amid surroundings most grateful to the eye<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span> weary
with hot red glare. There were green, waving crops and cool shade;
a perfumed breeze, strange luxury in El Hejaz; small birds warbled,
tiny cascades splashed from the wells. The Prophet delighted to
visit one of the wells at Kuba, the Bir el Aris. He would sit upon
its brink with bare legs hanging over the side; he honoured it,
moreover, with expectoration, which had the effect, say the
historians, of sweetening the water, which before was salt.</p>

<p>On August 28 arrived the great caravan from Damascus, and in the
plain outside the city there sprang up a town of tents of every
size, colour, and shape. A tribal war prevented me from carrying
out my intention of journeying overland to Muscat, so I determined
to proceed to Meccah with the Damascus caravan. Accordingly, on
August 31 I bade farewell to my friends at El Medinah, and hastened
after the caravan, which was proceeding to Meccah along the Darb el
Sharki, or eastern road. I had escaped all danger of detection at
El Medinah, and was now to travel to Meccah along a route wholly
unknown to Europeans.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;At the Shrine of the
Prophet</i></div>

<p>Owing to the caravan's annoying practice of night marching, in
accordance with the advice of Mohammed, I could see nothing of much
of the country through which we travelled. What I did see was
mostly a stony and sandy wilderness, with outcrops of black basalt;
occasionally we passed through a valley containing camel-grass and
acacia trees&mdash;mere vegetable mummies&mdash;and surrounded with
low hills of gravel and clay. At a large village called El Sufayna
we encountered the Baghdad caravan, and quarrelled hotly with it
for precedence on the route. At the halt before reaching this place
a Turkish pilgrim had been mortally wounded by an Arab with whom he
had quarrelled. The injured man was<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span> wrapped in a shroud,
placed in a half-dug grave, and left to die. This horrible fate, I
learnt, often befalls poor and solitary pilgrims whom illness or
accident incapacitates from proceeding.</p>

<p>At El Zaribah, an undulating plain amongst high granite hills,
we were ordered to assume the Ihram, or garb that must be worn by
pilgrims at Meccah. It consists simply of two strips of white
cotton cloth, with narrow red stripes and fringes. The women donned
white robes and hideous masks of palm leaves, for during the
ceremonies their veils must not touch their faces. We were warned
that we must not quarrel or use bad language; that we must not kill
game or cause animals to fly from us; that we were not to shave, or
cut or oil our hair, or scratch, save with the open palm; and that
we must not cover our heads. Any breach of these and numerous other
rules would have to be atoned for by the sacrifice of a sheep.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond this point we had a lively skirmish with
robbers, during which I earned a reputation for courage by calling
for my supper in the midst of the excitement. Meccah lies in a
winding valley, and is not to be seen until the pilgrim is close at
hand. At length, at one o'clock in the morning, in the course of
our eleventh march since leaving El Medinah, I was aroused by
general excitement. "Meccah! Meccah!" cried some voices; "the
Sanctuary! O the Sanctuary!" exclaimed others. I looked out from my
litter, and saw by the light of the southern stars the dim outlines
of a large city. We were passing over the last ridge by an
artificial cut, and presently descended to the northern suburb. I
took up my lodgings at the home of a boy, Mohammed, who had
accompanied me throughout the pilgrimage.</p>

<p>The Kaabah, or House of Allah, at Meccah, which has already been
accurately described by the traveller Burckhardt, stands in an
oblong square, enclosed by a great wall, 257 paces long, and 210
broad. The open space is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76">76</a></span> surrounded by colonnades united by
pointed arches and surmounted by domes. The Kaabah itself is an
oblong, flat-roofed structure, 22 paces long and 18 broad; the
height appears greater than the length. It is roughly built of
large irregular blocks of the grey Meccah stone. It is supposed to
have been built and rebuilt ten times&mdash;first by the angels of
Allah before the creation&mdash;secondly by Adam; thirdly by his
son Seth; fourthly by Abraham and his son; the eighth rebuilding
was during the lifetime of the Prophet.</p>

<p>On the morning of our arrival we bathed and proceeded in our
pilgrim garb to the sanctuary. There it lay, the bourne of my long
and weary pilgrimage. Here was no Egyptian antiquity, no Greek
beauty, no barbaric gorgeousness; yet the view was strange, unique;
and how few have looked upon the celebrated shrine! I may truly say
that of all the worshippers there, not one felt for the moment a
deeper emotion than did the Haji from the far north. But, to
confess humbling truth, theirs was the high feeling of religious
enthusiasm; mine was the ecstasy of gratified pride.</p>

<p>After drinking holy water, we approached as near as we could to
the sacred Black Stone, the subject of so much sacred Oriental
tradition, and prayed before it. The stone was surrounded by a
crowd of pilgrims, kissing it and pressing their hearts against it.
Then followed the ceremony of circumambulation. Seven times we
passed round the Kaabah, which was draped in a huge dark curtain,
to which pilgrims clung weeping. The boy Mohammed, by physical
violence, made a way to the Black Stone. While kissing it, I
narrowly observed it, and came away persuaded that it is a big
a&euml;rolite. After several other ceremonies, I left the holy
place thoroughly exhausted.</p>

<p>I did not enter the interior of the Kaabah until later. Nothing
could be more simple; a marble floor, red damask hangings, three
columns supporting the cross-beams of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span> the ceiling, many lamps
said to be of gold, and a safe of aloe-wood, sometimes containing
the key of the building, were all that was to be seen. Many
pilgrims refuse to enter the Kaabah for religious reasons. Those
who tread the hallowed floor are bound, among many other things,
never again to walk barefooted, to take up fire with the fingers,
or to tell lies. These stipulations, especially the last-named, are
too exacting for Orientals.</p>

<p>Meccah is an expensive place during the pilgrimage. The fees
levied by the guardians of the Kaabah are numerous and heavy. The
citizens make large sums out of the entertainment of pilgrims; they
are, for the most part, covetous spendthrifts, who anticipate the
pilgrimage by falling into the hands of the usurer, and then
endeavour to "skin" the richer Hajis.</p>

<p>On September 12 we set forth for the ceremonies at Mount Arafat,
where Adam rejoined Eve after the Fall, and where he was instructed
by the archangel Gabriel to erect a house of prayer. At least
50,000 pilgrims were encamped at the foot of the holy mountain. On
the day after our arrival we climbed to the sacred spots, and in
the afternoon a sermon was preached on the mountain, which I did
not hear&mdash;being engaged, let me confess, in a flirtation with
a fair Meccan. At length the preacher gave the signal to depart,
and everyone hurried away with might and main. The plain bristled
with tent-pegs, litters were crushed, pedestrians trampled and
camels overthrown; single combats with sticks and other weapons
took place; briefly, it was a state of chaotic confusion.</p>

<p>Next day was performed, at Muna, on the way back to Meccah, the
ceremony of stoning the Shaytan el Kabir, or Great Devil, who is
represented by a dwarf buttress placed against a rough wall of
stones. The buttress was surrounded by a swarm of pilgrims, mounted
and on foot, eager to get as near to the Great Devil as possible. I
found myself under the stomach of a fallen dromedary,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span> and had
great difficulty in extricating myself; the boy Mohammed emerged
from the tumult with a bleeding nose. Schooled by adversity, we
bided our time ere approaching to cast the seven stones required by
the ceremonial.</p>

<p>At Muna sheep were sacrificed by those pilgrims who, like
myself, had committed breaches of the rules. Literally, the land
stank. Five or six thousand animals were slain and cut up in this
Devil's punch-bowl. I leave the reader to imagine the rest. When I
had completed El Umrah, or the little pilgrimage&mdash;a
comparatively simple addition to the other ceremonies&mdash;I
deemed it expedient to leave Meccah. The danger of detection was
constantly before me; for had my disguise been penetrated, even
although the authorities had been willing to protect me, I should
certainly have been slain by indignant devotees.</p>

<p>Issuing from Meccah into the open plain, I felt a thrill of
pleasure&mdash;such pleasure as only the captive delivered from his
dungeon can experience. At dawn the next morning (September 23) we
sighted the maritime plain of Jeddah, situated 44 miles distant
from Meccah. Worn out with fatigue, I embarked on a vessel of the
Bombay Steam Navigation Company, received the greatest kindness
from the officers (I had revealed my identity to the British consul
at Jeddah), and in due time arrived at Suez.</p>

<p>Let me conclude in the words of a long-dead brother traveller,
Fa-hian, "I have been exposed to perils, and I have escaped them;
and my heart is moved with emotions of gratitude that I have been
permitted to effect the objects I had in view."</p>

<p>Sir William Francis Butler, G.C.B., born at Suirville,
Tipperary, Ireland, Oct. 31, 1838, was educated at the Jesuit
College, Tullabeg, King's County, and joined the British Army as an
ensign in the 69th Regiment in 1858. In 1877 he married Miss
Thompson, the celebrated painter of "The Roll Call." Sir William
Butler is a versatile writer, his works embracing records of
travel, histories of military campaigns, biographies, and fiction.
His first book was "The Great Lone Land," published in 1872. Half
the volume is devoted to a sketch of the early history of the
northwest regions of Canada, and to tracing the causes which led to
the rebellion of the settlers&mdash;principally
half-breeds&mdash;under Louis Riel, against the Canadian Government
in 1870. He describes the romantic part he took in the bloodless
campaign of the expeditionary force under Colonel (now Lord)
Wolseley, from Lake Superior to Winnipeg, for its suppression. In
the other half of the book he describes his journey on a special
mission for the Canadian Government to the Hudson Bay forts and
Indian camps in the valleys of the North and South Saskatchewan
Rivers. Sir William, as a writer, has the rich vocabulary of the
cultivated Celt; he presents many striking word pictures of the
natural scenery of the regions he traversed. He was almost the
first to proclaim the possibilities of the settlement of the
Saskatchewan prairies, now receiving such an influx of population
from all over the world.</p>
</div>

<p>It was a period of universal peace over the world. Some of the
great powers were even bent on disarming. To be more precise, the
time was the close of the year 1869. But in the very farthest West,
somewhere between the Rocky Mountains, Hudson Bay, and Lake
Superior, along the river called the Red River of the North, a
people, of whom nobody could tell who and what they were, had risen
in insurrection.</p>

<p>Had the country bordering on the Red River been an unpeopled
wilderness, the plan of transferring the land<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span> of the
Northwest from the Hudson Bay Company to the crown, and from the
crown to the Dominion of Canada, might have been an eminently wise
one. But, unfortunately, it was a country which had been originally
settled by the Earl of Selkirk in 1812 with Scots from the Highland
counties and the Orkney Islands, and subsequently by French
<i>voyageurs</i> from Lower Canada.</p>

<p>There were 15,000 persons living in peaceful possession of the
soil thus transferred, and these persons very naturally objected to
have themselves and their possessions signed away without one word
of consent or note of approbation. Hence began the rebellion led by
Louis Riel, who, with his followers, seized Fort Garry, with all
its stores of arms, guns, provisions, dominated the adjacent
village of Winnipeg, and established what was called a Provisional
Government. The rebels went steadily from violence to pillage, from
pillage to robbery, much supplemented by drunkenness and
dictatorial debauchery; and, finally, on March 4, 1870, with many
accessories of cruelty, shot to death a loyalist Canadian prisoner
they had taken, named Thomas Scott.</p>

<p>When, at the beginning of April 1870, news came of the projected
dispatch of an armed force from Canada against Louis Riel and his
malcontent followers at the Red River, there was one who hailed in
the approaching expedition the chance of a solution to the
difficulties which had beset him in his career. That one was
myself. Going to the nearest telegraph station, I sent a message to
the leader: "Please remember me." I sailed at once for Canada,
visited Toronto, Quebec, and Montreal, interviewed many personages,
and finally received instructions on June 12 from those in
authority to proceed west.</p>

<p>The expedition had started some time before for its true base of
operations, Fort William, on the north-west shore of Lake Superior.
It was to work its way from Lake Superior to the Red River through
British territory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id=
"Page_81">81</a></span> My instructions were to pass
round by the United States, and, after ascertaining the likelihood
of a Fenian intervention from the side of Minnesota and Dakota, to
arrange for supplies for the expeditionary force from St. Paul;
then to endeavour to reach Colonel Wolseley beyond the Red River,
with all the tidings I could gather as to the state of parties and
the chances of fight. At St. Paul my position was not at all a
pleasant one. My identity as a British officer became known, and to
escape unnecessary attention I paid a flying visit to Lake Superior
and then pushed on to Fort Abercrombie. I could find no evidence at
either place that there was a possibility at Vermilion Lakes,
eighty miles north of the latter place, of any filibusters making a
dash at the communications of the expeditionary force.</p>

<p>Afterwards, at Frog's Point on the Red River, I joined the
steamer International, which took me down to a promontory within a
couple of hundred yards of the junction of the Assiniboine and Red
rivers, where, with the connivance of the captain, I jumped ashore
and escaped Riel's scouts, who had heard of my coming, and had been
ordered by their leader to bring me into Fort Garry, "dead or
alive." After a pursuit of several hours in the dark, in which I
had a narrow "shave" of being captured, I reached the lower fort,
occupied by loyalists, and thence passed on next day to an Indian
settlement. This was on July 23.</p>

<p>Riel, learning where I was, sent a messenger to say that the
pursuit of me had all been a mistake, and that I might safely come
to Fort Garry. I was anxious to see the position of affairs at the
fort, and I repaired thither, passing without challenge a sentry
who was leaning lazily against a wall. There were two flagstaffs;
one flew a Union Jack in shreds and tatters, and the other a bit of
bunting with a <i>fleur-de-lys</i> and a shamrock on a white field.
I was conducted to a house, and asked if I wished to see Mr. Riel.
"To call upon him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id=
"Page_82">82</a></span> "Yes." "Certainly not!" "But if he
calls upon you?" "Then I will see him."</p>

<p>A door opened, and there entered a short, stout man with a large
head; a sallow, puffy face; a sharp, restless, intelligent eye; his
square-cut, massive forehead overhung by a mass of long and thickly
clustering hair, and marked with well-cut eyebrows&mdash;altogether
a remarkable-looking face. This was Louis Riel. He was dressed in a
curious mixture of clothing&mdash;a black frock coat, vest,
trousers, and Indian mocassins. In the course of the interview he
denied he was making preparation to resist the approaching British
expeditionary force. Everything he had done had been for the sake
of peace and to prevent bloodshed; but if the expedition tried to
put him out of his position, they would find they could not do it,
and he would keep what was his till a proper governor arrived!</p>

<p>Eventually he said: "Had I been your enemy, you would have known
it before. I heard you would not visit me, and although I felt
humiliated, I came to see you to show my pacific inclinations."</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Expedition in the
Wilderness</i></div>

<p>An hour later I left the fort, hastened to my old quarters at
the Indian settlement, and started by canoe to seek the coming
expedition. We paddled down the Red River to Lake Winnipeg,
crossing which we entered the mouth of the Winnipeg River, and came
to Fort Alexandra, a mile up stream.</p>

<p>This river has an immense volume of water. It descends 360 feet
in a distance of 160 miles by a series of terraces; it is full of
eddies and whirlpools; has every variety of waterfall, from chutes
to cataracts; it expands into lonely pine-cliffed lakes and
far-reaching island-studded bays. My Ojibway crew with infinite
skill accomplished the voyage up-stream, surmounting falls<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and cataracts by making twenty-seven portages in five days from
leaving Fort Alexandra, during which we had only encountered two
solitary Indians. It was on the evening of July 30 that we reached
the Lake of the Woods. Through a perfect maze of islands, we
steered across this wonderfully beautiful sheet of water to the
mouth of the Rainy River, up which we paddled to Fort Francis,
where we arrived on August 4, and heard, for the first time, news
of the expeditionary force.</p>

<p>We were now 400 miles from Fort Garry, and 180 miles beyond the
spot where I had counted upon falling in with them. Next morning we
paddled up to the foot of a rapid which the river makes as it flows
out of the Rainy Lake. Glancing along the broad waters of the lake
the glint of something strange caught my sight. Yes, there they
were! Coming with the full swing of eight paddles, swept a large
North-west canoe, its Iroquois paddlers timing their strokes to an
old French chant. We put into the rocky shore, and, mounting upon a
crag which guarded the head of the rapid, I waved to the leading
canoe as it swept along. In the centre sat a figure in uniform,
with a forage-cap on head, and I could see that he was scanning
through a field-glass the strange figure that waved a welcome from
the rock. Soon they entered the rapid, and at the foot, where I
joined the large canoe, Colonel Wolseley called out: "Where on
earth have you dropped from?" "From Fort Garry," said I; "twelve
days out, sir."</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe the voyage to Fort Garry along the
same route which I had taken in my canoe. The expeditionary force
consisted of 400 of the 60th Rifles, soldiers whose muscles and
sinews, taxed and tested by continuous toil, had been developed to
a pitch of excellence seldom equalled, and whose appearance and
physique told of the glorious climate of these northern solitudes.
There were also two regiments of Canadian militia, who had
undergone the same hardships. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span> accidents had occurred
during the journey of 600 miles through the wilderness. There had
been many "close shaves" of rock and rapid, but no life had been
lost.</p>

<p>The expedition camped on August 23 within six miles of Fort
Garry. All through the day the river-banks were enlivened with
people shouting welcome to the soldiers, and church-bells rang out
peals of gladness as the boats passed by. I was scouring the woods,
but found no Riel to dispute the passage. Next morning the troops
began to disembark from the boats for the final advance to Fort
Garry at a bend in the Red River named Point Douglas, two miles
from the fort. Preceded by skirmishers and followed by a
rear-guard, the little force drew near Fort Garry. There was no
sign of occupation; no flag on the flagstaff, no men upon the
walls, no sign of resistance visible. The gate facing the
Assiniboine River was open, and two mounted men entered the fort at
a gallop. On the top steps stood a tall, majestic-looking
man&mdash;an officer of the Hudson Bay Company, who alternately
welcomed with uplifted hat the new arrivals, and denounced in no
stinted terms one or two miserable-looking men who cowered beneath
his reproaches.</p>

<p>With insult and derision Riel and his colleagues had fled from
the scene of their triumph and their crimes. On the bare flagstaff
in the fort the Union Jack was once more hoisted, and from the
battery found in the square a royal salute of twenty-one guns told
settler and savage that the man who had been "elevated by the grace
of Providence and the suffrages of his fellow-citizens to the
highest position in the government of his country," had been
ignominiously expelled therefrom. The breakfast in Government House
was found untouched, and thus that tempest in the teacup, the
revolt of Red River, found a fitting conclusion in the president's
untasted tea!</p>

<p>Colonel Wolseley had been given no civil authority,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span> and a
wild scene of drunkenness and debauchery among the <i>voyageurs</i>
and Indians followed the arrival of the troops; but when the Hon.
Mr. Archibald, the Civil Governor, reached Winnipeg, he set matters
completely to rest. Before ten days elapsed the regular troops
commenced their return journey to Canada. On September 10, Colonel
Wolseley also took his leave, and I was left alone in Fort Garry.
The Red River expedition was over. My long journey seemed finished;
but I was mistaken, for it was only about to begin.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;In the Far North-west</i></div>

<p>Early in the second week of October the Hon. Mr. Archibald,
Lieutenant-governor of Manitoba, offered me, and I accepted, a
mission to the Saskatchewan Valley and through the Indian countries
of the West, and on the 24th of that month I quitted Fort Garry and
commenced my long journey. My instructions were to inquire into the
state of affairs in the territory; to obtain every particular in
connection with the rise and spread of the scourge of small-pox,
from which thousands of Indians, Esquimaux, and others had lately
perished; to distribute medicines suitable for its treatment to
every fort, post, clergyman, or intelligent person belonging to the
settlements, or outside the Hudson Bay Company's posts.</p>

<p>I made the first stage of 230 miles in five days to Fort Ellice,
where we stayed a couple of days to make preparations for the
winter journey into the Great Lone Land. It was near the close of
the Indian summer, and we travelled at the rate of fifty miles a
day, I riding my little game horse Blackie, while the Red River
cart, containing the baggage and medicines, was drawn by six
horses&mdash;three in the shafts for a spell, the other three
running free alongside.</p>

<p>Between Fort Ellice and Carlton Fort you pass<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span> through
the region of the Touchwood Hills, around which are immense plains
scored with the tracks of the countless buffaloes which, until a
few years ago, roamed in vast herds between the Saskatchewan and
Assiniboine. On November 4, and on several successive days
thereafter, snowstorms burst upon us, and the whole country around
was hidden in the dense mist of driving snowflakes.</p>

<p>On the 7th we emerged upon a hill plateau, and 300 feet below
was raging the mighty South Saskatchewan, with great masses of
floating, grinding ice. We contrived a raft made from the box of
the wagon, but we could not accomplish the passage in it. Later on,
hard frost having set in, we were able to cross the river on foot,
with the loss of my horse Blackie, and when half a dozen of the
twenty miles to Carlton Fort had been covered we met a party from
it, including the officer in charge. The first question was, "What
of the plague?" And the answer was that it had burned itself
out.</p>

<p>On November 14, we set out again on our western journey, and
crossed the North Saskatchewan. On account of the snow we had
discarded our cart and used sleds. Travelling over hill and dale
and frozen lake, we lost the way in the wilderness, but, taking a
line by myself, steering by the stars, I came on November 17 to
Fort Pitt, after having been fifteen hours on end in the
saddle.</p>

<p>Fort Pitt was free of small-pox, but 100 Crees had perished
close around its stockades. The unburied dead lay for days, until
the wolves came and fought over the decaying bodies. The living
remnant had fled in despair six weeks before my arrival. When we
renewed our journey on November 20, the weather became
comparatively mild, and our course lay through rich, well-watered
valleys with groves of spruce and pine. Edmonton, which we reached
on November 26, is the headquarters of the Hudson Bay Company's
Saskatchewan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">
87</a></span> trade and the residence of a chief factor of the
corporation.</p>

<p>My objective after leaving Edmonton on December 1 was Rocky
Mountain House, 180 miles distant by horse-trail. Our way led over
hills and plains and the great frozen Gull Lake to the Pas-co-pee,
or Blind Man's River, where we camped on December 3. At midnight
there was a heavy storm of snow. Next morning we rode through the
defiles of the Three Medicine Hills, and after midday, at the
western termination of the last gorge, there lay before me a sight
to be long remembered. The great chain of the Rocky Mountains rose
their snow-clad sierras in endless succession and in unclouded
glory. The snow had cleared the atmosphere, the sky was coldly
bright.</p>

<p>An immense plain stretched from my feet to the mountains&mdash;a
plain so vast that every object of hill and wood and lake lay
dwarfed into one continuous level. And at the back of this level,
beyond the pines and lakes and the river courses, rose the giant
range, solid, impassable, silent&mdash;a mighty barrier rising
amidst an immense land, standing sentinel over the plains and
prairies of America, over the measureless solitudes of this Great
Lone Land.</p>

<p>That night there came a frost, and on the morning of November 5
my thermometer showed 22 degrees below zero. Riding through the
foot hills and pine woods we suddenly emerged on the high banks of
the Saskatchewan, and in the mid distance of a deep valley was the
Mountain House. There was great excitement at my arrival. My
journey from the Red River had occupied 41 days, and I had ridden
in that time 1,180 miles.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;On the Dog Trail to Fort
Garry</i></div>

<p>I said good-bye to my friends at the Mountain House on December
12, and once more turned my footsteps<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span> eastward. Without
incident we reached Edmonton, and there changed horses and
travelled thenceforth, setting out on December 20, with three
trains of dogs&mdash;one to carry myself, and the others to carry
provisions and baggage. In fifty days of dog travel we covered a
distance of 1,300 miles, with the cold sometimes 45 degrees below
zero. Great as were the hardships and privations, the dog trail had
many moments of keen pleasure. It was January 19 when we reached
the high ground which looks down upon the forks of the Saskatchewan
River.</p>

<p>We now entered the great sub-Arctic pine forest, the most
important preserve of those animals whose skins are rated in the
markets of Europe at four times their weight in gold. On January
22, 1871, we reached Fort-a-la-Corne, where an old travel-worn
Indian came with a mail which contained news of the surrender of
Metz, the investment of Paris, the tearing up of the Treaty of
Paris by the Prussians; and on being questioned the old man said he
had heard at Fort Garry that there was war, and that England was
gaining the day!</p>

<p>To cross with celerity the 700 miles lying between me and Fort
Garry became the chief object of my life. The next morning, with
the lightest of equipment, I started for Cumberland House, the
oldest post of the Hudson Bay Company in the interior. There I
obtained, at fabulous expense, a train of pure Esquimaux dogs, and
started on January 31 through a region of frozen swamp for fully
100 miles. On February 7 we reached Cedar Lake, thence sped on to
Lake Winnipegoosis and Shoal Lake, across a belt of forest to
Waterhen River, which carries the surplus floods of Lake
Winnipegoosis to Lake Manitoba, the whole length of which we
traversed, camping at night on the wooded shore, and on February 19
arrived at a mission-house fifty miles from Fort Garry. Not without
a feeling of regret was the old work<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span> of tree-cutting,
fire-making, supper-frying, and dog-feeding gone through for the
last time.</p>

<p>My mission was accomplished; but in the after-time, 'midst the
smoke and hum of cities, 'midst the prayer of churches, it needs
but little cause to recall again to the wanderer the message of the
immense meadows where far away at the portals of the setting sun
lies the Great Lone Land.</p>

<h4><a name="Page_89a" id="Page_89a">The Wild North Land</a></h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;From Civilisation to
Savagery</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This was Sir William Francis Butler's second book on the regions
and the people of the great Northwest of Canada. The fascination of
the wilderness had got a grip upon him, and he conveys something of
the same fascination to the reader, whom he allures through the
immense and solemn aisles of the great sub-Arctic forest, makes him
a joint-hunter after the bison on the Great Prairie, or after the
marten and the beaver on the tributary streams to the Saskatchewan
and the Assiniboine rivers. The reader is carried into the
fastnesses of the rapidly-disappearing Red Man in mid-winter, and
there are graphic revelations of the daring deeds of the half-breed
descendants of the white pioneers of the Hudson Bay Company and the
<i>habitants</i> from Lower Canada, who were the great discoverers
and exploiters of the vast country between the Great Lakes and the
Rocky Mountains, and beyond to the Pacific. Sir William's story is
restrained and convincing, and his descriptions of his adventures
in the Wild North Land and its wonderful scenery charm by their
eloquence and poetic beauty.</p>
</div>

<p>It was late in the month of September, 1872, when, after a
summer of travel in Canada and the United States, I drew near the
banks of the Red River of the North. Two years had worked many
changes in scene and society. A "city" stood on the spot where,
during a former visit, a midnight storm had burst upon me in <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
the then untenanted prairie. Representative institutions had been
established in the new province of Manitoba. Civilisation had
developed itself in other ways, but amidst these changes of scene
and society there was one thing still unchanged on the confines of
the Red River. Close to the stream of Frog's Point an old friend
met me with many tokens of recognition. It was my Esquimaux dog,
Cerf-Vola, who had led my train from Cumberland on the lower
Saskatchewan, across the ice of the Great Lakes. To become the
owner of this old friend again and of his new companions, Spanker
and Pony, was a work of necessity.</p>

<p>In the earliest days of October all phases of civilisation were
passed with little regret, and at the Rat Creek, near the southern
shore of Lake Manitoba, I bade good-bye to society, pushed on to the
Hudson Bay Company's post of Beaver Creek, from which point, with
one man, three horses, three dogs, and all the requisites of food,
arms and raiment, I started on October 14 for the North-west. I was
virtually alone. My only human associate was a worthless half-breed
taken at chance. But I had other companions. A good dog is so much
more a nobler beast than an indifferent man that one sometimes
gladly exchanges the society of the one for that of the other; and
Cerf-Vola was that dog.</p>

<p>A long distance of rolling plain, of hills fringed with
thickets, of treeless wastes and lakes spreading into unseen
declivities, stretches from between the Qu'-Appelle to the
Saskatchewan rivers. Through it the great trail to the North lays
its long, winding course, and over it broods the loneliness of the
untenanted. Alone in the vast waste Mount Spathanaw Watchi lifts
his head; a lonely grave at top; around 400 miles of horizon.
Reduced thus to its own nakedness, space stands forth with almost
terrible grandeur. It was October 25 when I once more drew near the
South Saskatchewan, and crossing to the southern shore I
turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">
91</a></span> eastward through a rich undulating land, and made
for the Grand Forks of the Saskatchewan, which we reached in the
last days of October.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a wilder scene than that presented
from the tongue of land which rises over the junction of the North
and South Saskatchewan rivers. One river has travelled through 800
miles of rich rolling landscape; the other has run its course of
900 miles through arid solitudes. Both have their sources in
mountain summits where the avalanche thundered forth to solitude
the tiding of their birth.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Twin Dwellers of the
Prairie</i></div>

<p>At the foot of the high ridge which marks the junction of these
two rivers was a winter hut built by two friends who proposed to
accompany me part of the long journey I meant to take into the Wild
North Land. Our winter stock of meat had first to be gathered in,
and we accordingly turned our faces westward in quest of buffalo.
The snow had begun to fall in many storms, and the landscape was
wrapped in its winter mantle. The buffalo were 200 miles distant on
the Great Prairie. Only two wild creatures have made this grassy
desert their home&mdash;the Indian and the bison. Of the origin of
the strange, wild hunter, the keen untutored scholar of Nature, who
sickens beneath our civilisation, and dies amidst our prosperity,
fifty writers have broached various theories; but to me it seems
that he is of an older and more remote race than our own&mdash;a
stock coeval with a shadowy age, a remnant of an earlier creation
which has vanished from the earth, preserved in these wilds.</p>

<p>As to the other wild creatures who have made their dwelling on
the Great Prairie, the millions and millions of dusky bison, during
whose migration from the Far South to the Far North the earth
trembled beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">92</a></span> their tramp, and the air was filled
with the deep, bellowing of their unnumbered throats, no one can
tell their origin. Before the advent of the white man these twin
dwellers on the Great Prairie are fast disappearing.</p>

<p>It was mid-November before we reached the buffalo, and it was on
December 3, having secured enough animals to make the needful
pemmican&mdash;a hard mixture of fat and dried buffalo meat pounded
down into a solid mass&mdash;for our long journey, that, with thin
and tired horses, we returned to the Forks of the Saskatchewan. The
cold had set in unusually early, and even in mid-November the
thermometer had fallen to thirty degrees below zero, and unmittened
fingers in handling the rifle became frozen. During the sixteen
days in which we traversed the Great Prairie on our return journey
we had not seen one human being moving over it. The picture of
desolation was complete.</p>

<p>When the year was drawing to its close, two Cree Indians pitched
their lodge on the opposite side of the North Saskatchewan and
afforded us not a little food for amusement in the long winter
evenings. In the Red Man's mental composition there is mixed up
much simplicity and cunning, close reasoning, and child-like
suspicion, much natural quickness, sense of humour, credulousness,
power of observation, faith and fun and selfishness.</p>

<p>Preparations had been made for my contemplated journey to the
frozen North. I only waited the arrival of the winter packet which
was to be carried 3,000 miles to distant stations of the Hudson Bay
Company. A score of different dog teams had handled it; it had
camped more than 100 nights in the Great Northern forests; but the
Indian postman, with dogs and mail, had disappeared in a water-hole
in the Saskatchewan river. On February 3, therefore, I set out with
my dog team, but without letters.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards we came to Carlton Fort, where<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span> there
was a great gathering of "agents" from all the forts of the Hudson
Bay Company in the north and west, many of them 2,000 miles
distant, and one 4,000 miles. These "agents," or "winterers," as
they are sometimes called, have to face for a long season hardship,
famine, disease, and a rigorous climate. God knows their lives are
hard. They hail generally from the remote isles or highlands of
Scotland. The routine of their lives is to travel on foot a
thousand miles in winter's darkest time, to live upon the coarsest
food, to feel cold such as Englishmen in England cannot even
comprehend, often to starve, always to dwell in exile from the
great world. Perchance, betimes, the savage scene is lost in a
dreamy vision of some lonely Scottish loch, some Druid mound in
far-away Lewis, some vista of a fireside, when storm howled and
waves ran high on the beach at Stornoway.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;The Frozen Trail</i></div>

<p>It was brilliant moonlight on February 11 when we left Fort
Carlton, and days of rapid travel carried us far to the north into
the great sub-Arctic forest, a line of lakes forming its rampart of
defence against the wasting fires of the prairie region. The cold
was so intense that, at mid-day with the sun shining, the
thermometer stood at 26 degrees below zero. Right in our teeth blew
the bitter blast; the dogs, with low-bent heads, tugged steadily
onward; the half-breeds and Indians who drove our teams wrapped
their blankets round their heads. To run was instantly to freeze
one's face; to lie on the sled was to chill through the body to the
very marrow. It was impossible to face it long, and over and over
again we had to put in to shore amongst the trees, make a fire, and
boil some tea. Thus we trudged, until we arrived at the Forks of
the Athabasca on the last day of February.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>In the small fort at the Forks we camped for four days to enjoy
a rest, make up new dog trains&mdash;Cerf-Vola never gave
out&mdash;and partake of the tender steak of the wood-buffalo. For
many days I had regularly used snow-shoes, and now I seldom sought
the respite of the sled, but tramped behind the dogs. Over marsh
and frozen river and portage we lagged till, on March 6, a vast
lake opened out upon our gaze, on the rising shore of which were
the clustered buildings of a large fort, with a red flag flying
above them in the cold north blast. The lake was Athabasca, the
clustered buildings Fort Chipewyan, and the flag&mdash;well, we all
knew it; but it is only when the wanderer's eye meets it in some
lone spot like this that he turns to it as the emblem of a home
which distance has shrined deeper in his heart.</p>

<p>Athabasca means "the meeting place of many waters." In its bosom
many rivers unite their currents, and from its northwestern rim
pours the Slave River, the true Mackenzie. Its first English
discoverer called it the "Lake of the Hills." A more appropriate
title would have been the "Lake of the Winds," for fierce and wild
storms sweep over its waves.</p>

<p>Once more the sleds were packed, once more the untiring
Cerf-Vola took his place in the leading harness, and the word
"march" was given. On the evening of March 12 I camped alone in the
wilderness, for the three Indians and half-breeds who accompanied
me were alien in every thought and feeling, and on the fourth day
after we were on the banks of the Peace River.</p>

<p>Through 300 miles of mountain the Peace River takes its course.
Countless creeks and rivers seeks its waters; 200 miles from its
source it cleaves the main Rocky Mountain chain through a chasm
whose straight, steep cliffs frown down on the black water through
6,000 feet of dizzy verge. Farther on it curves, and for 500 miles
flows in a deep, narrow valley, from 700 feet<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span> to 800
feet below the level of the surrounding plateau. Then it reaches a
lower level, the banks become of moderate elevation, the country is
densely wooded, the large river winds in serpentine bends through
an alluvial valley; the current, once so strong, becomes sluggish,
until at last it pours itself through a delta of low-lying drift
into the Slave River, and its long course of 1,100 miles is
ended.</p>

<p>For 900 miles there are only two breaks in the even flow of its
waters&mdash;one at a point 250 miles from its mouth, a fall of
eight feet with a short rapid above it; the other is the great
mountain ca&ntilde;on on the outer and lower range of the Rocky
Mountains, where a portage of twelve miles is necessary. This Peace
River was discovered in 1792 by a daring Scotsman named Alexander
Mackenzie, who was the first European that ever passed the Rocky
Mountains and crossed the northern continent of America. The Peace
River is the land of the moose, and, winter and summer, hunter and
trader, along the whole length of 900 miles, between the Peace and
Athabasca, live upon its delicious venison.</p>

<p>This, too, is the country of the Beaver Indians. It is not
uncommon for a single Indian to render from his winter trapping 200
marten skins, and not less than 20,000 beavers are annually killed
by the tribe. Towards the end of March the sun had become warm
enough to soften the surface snow, and therefore we were compelled
to travel during the night, when the frost hardened it, and sleep
all day.</p>

<p>On April 1, approaching the fort of Dunvegan, we were steering
between two huge walls of sandstone rock which towered up 700 feet
above the shore. Right in our onward track stood a large, dusky
wolf. My dogs caught sight of him, and in an instant they gave
chase. The wolf kept the centre of the river, and the carriole
bounded from snow-pack to snow-pack, or shot along the level ice.
The wolf, however, sought refuge amidst<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span> the rocky shore, and
the dogs turned along the trail again. Two hours later we reached
Dunvegan, after having travelled incessantly for four-and-twenty
hours. Here I rested for three days, and then pushed on to Fort St.
John&mdash;our last dog march.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Through Ca&ntilde;on and
Rapid</i></div>

<p>The time of winter travel had drawn to its close; the ice-road
had done its work. From April 15 the river began to break its ice
covering, and on April 20 spring had arrived; and with bud and sun
and shower came the first mosquito. I left Fort St. John on April
22, having parted with my dog train, except the faithful, untiring
Cerf-Vola; crossed the river on an ice bridge at great risk, and
horses and men scrambled up 1,000 feet to the top of the plateau.
There we mounted our steeds, and for two days followed the trail
through a country the beauty of which it is not easy to exaggerate,
and reached Half-way River, which we forded at infinite risk on a
roughly constructed raft, the horses being compelled to swim the
torrent.</p>

<p>Crossing the Peace River at the fort known as Hudson's Hope in a
frail canoe, I narrowly escaped drowning by the craft upsetting,
losing gun and revolver, although, wonderful to relate, the gun was
recovered next day by my half-breed attendant, who dredged it with
a line and fish-hook! From Hudson's Hope we made the portage of ten
miles which avoids the great ca&ntilde;on of the Peace River at the
farther end of which the river becomes navigable for canoes; and
there we waited till April 29, when the ice in the upper part of
the river broke up.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity of the delay to explore the ca&ntilde;on,
which at this point is 900 feet deep. Advancing cautiously to the
smooth edge of the chasm, I seized hold of a spruce-tree and looked
down. Below lay one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id=
"Page_97">97</a></span> of those grim glimpses which the earth
holds hidden, save from the eagle and the mid-day sun. Caught in a
dark prison of stupendous cliffs, hollowed beneath so that the
topmost ledge literally hung over the boiling abyss of water, the
river foamed and lashed against rock and precipice. The rocks at
the base held the record of its wrath in great trunks of trees, and
blocks of ice lying piled and smashed in shapeless ruin. It is
difficult to imagine by what process the mighty river had cloven
asunder this wilderness of rock&mdash;giving us the singular
spectacle, after it had cleared the ca&ntilde;on, of a wide, deep,
tranquil stream flowing through the principal mountain range of the
American continent.</p>

<p>On May Day we started, a company of four&mdash;Little Jacques (a
French miner and trapper) as captain of the boat, another miner, my
Scottish half-breed servant, Kalder, myself, and Cerf-Vola&mdash;to
pole and paddle up-stream, fighting the battle with the current.
Many a near shave we had with the ice-floes and ice-jams. A week
afterwards we emerged from the pass to the open country, and before
us lay the central mountain system of north British Columbia, the
highest snowcapped peak of which I named Mount Garnet Wolseley, and
there we camped. A mile from camp a moose emerged from the forest;
I took bead on him and fired, aiming just below his long ears.
There was a single plunge in the water; the giant head went down,
and all was quiet. We towed him ashore and cut him up as he lay
stranded like a whale. Directly opposite the camp a huge cone
mountain arose up some eight or nine thousand feet above us, and
just ere evening fell his topmost peak, glowing white in the
sunlight, became mirrored in the clear, quiet river, while the life
stream of the moose flowed out over the tranquil surface, dyeing
the nearer waters into brilliant crimson.</p>

<p>We came to the forks of the Peace River on May 9, took that
branch known as the Ominica, and through<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span> perils without
number attempted to conquer in our canoe the passage of the deep
black ca&ntilde;on. Again and again we were beaten back, and even
lost our canoe in the rapids, although we afterwards recovered it
by building a raft. We discovered a mining prospector who had a
canoe at the upper end of the ca&ntilde;on, and agreed to exchange
canoes&mdash;he taking ours for his voyage down the river, while we
took his, after making a portage to a spot above the ca&ntilde;on,
where it had been cached.</p>

<p>Three days after we entered the great central snowy range of
north British Columbia; and on the night of May 19 camped at last
at the mouth of the Wolverine Creek by quiet water. There we parted
with the river, having climbed up to near the snow-line, and next
day reached the mining camp of Germansen, where I stayed several
days and became acquainted personally or by reputation with the
leading "boys" of the northern mining country. Twelve miles from
Germansen there was another mining camp, the Mansen, and from
thence on to May 25 I started, in company with an express agent, to
walk across the Bald Mountains, on the topmost ridge of which the
snow ever dwells. On the other side of the mountains we packed our
goods on horses which we had obtained, and pushed forward, only to
encounter storms of snow and sleet on the summit of the table-land
which divides the Arctic and the Pacific Oceans.</p>

<p>Then followed the trail of the long ascent up Look-Out Mountain,
from which we gazed on 500 snowy peaks along the horizon, while the
slopes immediately beneath us were covered with the Douglas pine,
the monarch of the Columbian forest. It was May 29 when we entered
the last post of the Hudson Bay Company, St. James Fort on the
southeast shore of the beautiful Stuart's Lake, the favourite home
of innumerable salmon and colossal sturgeon, some of the latter
weighing as much as 800 lb. After a day's delay I parted with<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
my half-breed Kalder, took canoe down the Stuart River to the spot
where the trail crosses the stream, and then camped for the night.
Having procured horses, we rode through a rich land which fringes
the banks of the Nacharcole River. Then during the first two days
of June we journeyed through a wild, undulating country, filled
with lakes and rolling hills, and finally drew rein on a ridge
overlooking Quesnelle. Before me spread civilisation and the waters
of the Pacific; behind me vague and vast, lay a hundred memories of
the Wild North Land; and for many reasons it is fitting to end this
story here.</p>

<h4>JAMES COOK</h4>

<h4>Voyages Round the World</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;To the South Seas</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Captain James Cook, son of a farm labourer, was born at Martin
Cleveland, England, on October 27, 1728. Picking up knowledge at
the village school, tending cows in the fields, apprenticed at
Staithes, near Whitby, the boy eventually ran away to sea. In 1755,
volunteering for the Royal Navy, he sailed to North America in the
Eagle; then, promoted to be master of the Mercury, he did efficient
service in surveying the St. Lawrence in co-operation with General
Wolfe. His first voyage of discovery was in the Endeavour with a
party to observe the transit of Venus in 1768, and after three
years he returned, to start again, on his second voyage, in 1772,
with the Resolution and Adventure to verify reports of a southern
continent in the Pacific. His third and last voyage in the
Resolution led him to explore the coast of North America as far as
Icy Cape, and returning to the Sandwich Islands, he met his death
while pacifying some angry natives on the shore of Owhyhee
(Hawaii), on February 14, 1779. The original folio edition of the
"Voyages" was published in 1784, compiled from journals of Cook,
Banks, Solander, and others who accompanied him.</p>
</div>

<p>We left Plymouth Sound on August 26, 1768, and spent five days
at Madeira, where Nature has been very liberal with her gifts, but
the people lack industry. On reaching Rio de Janeiro, the captain
met with much incivility from the viceroy, who would not let him
land for a long time; but when we walked through the town the
females showed their welcome by throwing nosegays from the windows.
Dr. Solander and two other gentlemen of our party received so many
of these love-tokens that they threw them away by hatfuls.</p>

<p>When we came in sight of Tierra del Fuego, the captain went
ashore to discourse with the natives, who rose up and threw away
the small sticks which they held in<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span> their hands, as a
token of amity. Snow fell thick, and we were warned by the doctor
that "whoever sits down will sleep, and whoever sleeps will wake no
more." But he soon felt so drowsy that he lay down, and we could
hardly keep him awake. Setting sail again, we passed the strait of
Le Maire and doubled Cape Horn, and then, as the ship came near to
Otaheite, where the transit of Venus was observed, the captain
issued a new rule to this effect: "That in order to prevent
quarrels and confusion, every one of the ship's crew should
endeavour to treat the inhabitants of Otaheite with humanity, and
by all fair means to cultivate a friendship with them."</p>

<p>On New Year's Day, 1770, we passed Queen Charlotte's Sound,
calling the point Cape Farewell. We found the natives of New
Zealand modest and reserved in their behaviour, and, sailing
northward for New Holland, we called a bay Botany Bay because of
the number of plants discovered there, and another Trinity Bay
because it was discovered on Trinity Sunday. After much dangerous
navigation, the ship was brought to in Endeavour River to be
refitted. On a clear day, Mr. Green, the astronomer, and other
gentlemen had landed on an island to observe the transit of
Mercury, and for this reason this spot was called Mercury Bay.</p>

<p>Later, we discovered the mainland beyond York Islands, and here
the captain displayed the English colours, and called it New South
Wales, firing three volleys in the name of the king of Great
Britain. After we had left Booby Island in search of New Guinea, we
came in sight of a small island, and some of the officers strongly
urged the captain to send a party of men on shore to cut down the
cocoanut-trees for the sake of the fruit. This, with equal wisdom
and humanity, he peremptorily refused as unjust and cruel, sensible
that the poor Indians, who could not brook even the landing of a
small party on their coast, would have made vigorous efforts to
defend their property.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102">102</a></span>Shortly afterwards, we were surprised at the sight of an island
W.S.W., which we flattered ourselves was a new discovery. Before
noon we had sight of houses, groves of trees, and flocks of sheep,
and after the boat had put off to land, horsemen were seen from the
ship, one of whom had a lace hat on, and was dressed in a coat and
waistcoat of the fashion of Europe. The Dutch colours were hoisted
over the town, and the rajah paid us a visit on board, accepting
gifts of an English dog and a spying-glass. During a short stay on
shore for the purchase of provisions, we found that the Dutch
agent, Mr. Lange, was not keeping faith with us. At his instigation
the Portuguese were driving away such of the Indians as had brought
palm-syrup and fowls to sell.</p>

<p>At this juncture Captain Cook, happening to look at the old man
who had been distinguished by the name of Prime Minister, imagined
that he saw in his features a disapprobation of the present
proceedings, and willing to improve the advantage, he grasped the
Indian's hand, and gave him an old broadsword. This well-timed
present produced all the good effects that could be wished. The
prime minister was enraptured at so honourable a mark of
distinction, and, brandishing his sword over the head of the
impertinent Portuguese, he made both him and the men who commanded
the party sit down behind him on the ground, and the whole business
was accomplished.</p>

<p>This island of Savu is between twenty and thirty miles long; the
women wear a kind of petticoat held up by girdles of beads, the
king and his minister a nightgown of coarse chintz, carrying a
silver-headed cane.</p>

<p>On October 10, 1770, the captain and the rest of the gentlemen
went ashore on reaching the harbour of Batavia. Here the Endeavour
had to be refitted, and intermittent fever laid many of our party
low. Our surgeon, Dr. Monkhouse, died, our Indian boy, Tayeto, paid
the debt of Nature, and Captain Cook himself was taken ill.</p>

<p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">
103</a></span>We were glad to steer for Java, and on our way to the Cape of
Good Hope the water was purified with lime and the decks washed
with vinegar to prevent infection of fever. After a little stay at
St. Helena we sighted Beachy Head, and landed at Deal, where the
ship's company indulged freely in that mirth and social jollity
common to all English sailors upon their return from a long voyage,
who as readily forget hardships and dangers as with alacrity and
bravery they encounter them.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Round the World via the
Antarctic</i></div>

<p>The King's expectation not being wholly answered, Captain Cook
was appointed to the Resolution, and Captain Furneaux to the
Adventure, both ships being fully equipped, with instructions to
find Cape Circumcision, said to be in latitude 54&deg; S. and about
11&deg; 20' E. longitude from Greenwich. Captain Cook was to
endeavour to discover whether this was part of the supposed
continent or only the promontory of an island, and then to continue
his journey southward and then eastward.</p>

<p>On Monday, July 13, 1772, the two ships sailed from Plymouth,
passing the Eddystone, and after visiting the islands of Canaria,
Teneriffe, and others, reached the Cape of Good Hope on September
29. Here we stayed until November 22, when we directed our course
towards the Antarctic circle, meeting on December 8 with a gale of
such fury that we could carry no sails, and were driven by this
means to eastward of our intended course, not the least hope
remaining of our reaching Cape Circumcision.</p>

<p>We now encountered in 51&ordm; 50' S. latitude and 21&ordm; 3'
E. longitude some ice islands. The dismal scene, a view to which we
were unaccustomed, was varied as well by birds of the petrel kind
as by several whales which made their appearance among the ice, and
afforded us some idea of a southern Greenland. But though the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">
104</a></span> appearance of the ice with the waves breaking over
it might afford a few minutes' pleasure to the eye, yet it could
not fail to fill us with horror when we reflected on our danger,
for the ship would be dashed to pieces in a moment were she to get
against the weather side of these islands, where the sea runs high.
Captain Cook had directed the Adventure, in case of separation, to
cruise three days in that place, but in a thick fog we lost sight
of her. This was a dismal prospect, for we now were exposed to the
dangers of the frozen climate without the company of our fellow
voyagers, which before had relieved our spirits when we considered
we were not entirely alone in case we lost our vessel.</p>

<p>The spirits of our sailors were greatly exhilarated when we
reached Dusky Bay, New Zealand. Landing a shooting party at Duck
Cove, we found a native with his club and some women behind him,
who would not move. His fears, however, were all dissipated by
Captain Cook going up to embrace him. After a stay here we opened
Queen Charlotte's Sound and found the Adventure at anchor; none can
describe the joy we felt at this most happy meeting. They had
experienced terrible weather, and having made no discovery of land,
determined to bear away from Van Diemen's Land, which was supposed
to join New Holland and was discovered by Tasman, in 1642 <span
class="smcap">A.D</span>. Here they refitted their ship, and after
three months' separation met us again.</p>

<p>During all this arduous experience of seamanship, sometimes
involved in sheets of snow, and in mists so dark that a man on the
forecastle could not be seen from the quarter-deck, it was
astonishing that the crew of the Resolution should continue in
perfect health. Nothing can redound more to the honour of Captain
Cook than his paying particular attention to the preservation of
health among his company. By observing the strictest discipline
from the highest to the lowest, his commands were duly observed and
punctually executed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id=
"Page_105">105</a></span>After a lengthened stay with the New Zealanders, and all hopes
of discovering a continent having now vanished, we were induced to
believe that there is no southern continent between New Zealand and
America, and, steering clear the island, we made our way to
Otaheite, where the Resolution lost her lower anchor in the bay.
Excursions were made inland, and King Otoo, a personable man, six
feet in height, and about thirty years of age, treated the party
with great entertainment.</p>

<p>On January 30, 1774, we sailed from New Zealand, and reaching
latitude 67&deg; 5' S., we found an immense field of ice with
ninety-seven ice-hills glistening white in the distance. Captain
Cook says: "I will not say it was impossible anywhere to get
further to the south, but the attempting it would have been a
dangerous and rash enterprise, and what I believe no man in any
situation would have thought of."</p>

<p>We therefore sailed northward again, meeting with heavy storms,
and the captain, being taken ill with a colic, and in the extremity
of the case, the doctor fed him with the flesh of a favourite
dog.</p>

<p>On the discovery of Palmerston Island&mdash;named after one of
the Lords of the Admiralty&mdash;and Savage Island, as appropriate
to the character of the natives, we had some adventures with the
Mallicos, who express their admiration by hissing like a goose.</p>

<p>We stayed some time in Tanna, with its volcano furiously
burning, and then steering south-west, we discovered an uninhabited
island, which Captain Cook named Norfolk Island, in honour of the
noble family of Howard. We reached the Straits of Magalhaes, and,
going north, the captain gave the names of Cumberland Bay and the
Isle of Georgia, and then we found a land ice-bound and
inhospitable. At last we reached home, landing at Portsmouth on
July 30, 1775.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id=
"Page_106">106</a></span><i>III.&mdash;The Pacific Isles and the Arctic
Circle</i></div>

<p>Former navigators had returned to Europe by the Cape of Good
Hope; the arduous task was now assigned to Captain Cook of
attempting it by reaching the high northern latitudes between Asia
and America. He was then ordered to proceed to Otaheite, or the
Society Islands, and then, having crossed the Equator into the
northern tropics, to hold such a course as might best probably give
success to the attempt of finding out a northern passage.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of July 11, 1776, Captain Cook set sail from
Plymouth in the Resolution, giving orders to Captain Clerke to
follow in the Discovery. After a short stay at Santa Cruz, in the
island of Teneriffe, we were joined by the Discovery at Cape
Town.</p>

<p>Leaving the Cape, we passed some islands, which Captain Cook
named Princes Islands, and made for the land discovered by M. de
Kerguelen. Here, in a bay, we celebrated Christmas rejoicings amid
desolate surroundings. The captain named it Christmas Harbour, and
wrote on the other side of a piece of parchment, found in a bottle,
these words: <i>Naves Resolution et Discovery de Rege Magn&aelig;
Britanni&aelig; Decembris 1776</i>, and buried the same beneath a
pile of stones, waving above it the British flag.</p>

<p>Having failed to see a human being on shore, he sailed to Van
Diemen's Land, and took the ships into Adventure Bay for water and
wood. The natives, with whom we were conversant, seemed mild and
cheerful, with little of that savage appearance common to people in
their situation, nor did they discover the least reserve or
jealousy in their intercourse with strangers.</p>

<p>On our landing at Annamooka, in the Friendly Islands, we were
entertained with great civility by Toobou, the chief, who gave us
much amusement by a sort of pantomime,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span> in which some
prizefighters displayed their feats of arms, and this part of the
drama concluded with the presentation of some laughable story which
produced among the chiefs and their attendants the most immoderate
mirth. This friendly reception was also repeated in the island of
Hapaee, where Captain Cook ordered an exhibition of fireworks, and
in return the king, Feenou, gave us an exhibition of dances in
which twenty women entered a circle, whose hands were adorned with
garlands of crimson flowers, and many of their persons were
decorated with leaves of trees, curiously scalloped, and ornamented
at the edges. In the island of Matavai it is impossible to give an
adequate idea of the joy of the natives on our arrival. The shores
everywhere resounded with the name of Cook; not a child that could
lisp "Toote" was silent.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the northern hemisphere we passed a cluster
of isles which Captain Cook distinguished by the name of Sandwich
Islands, in honour of the Earl of Sandwich. They are not inferior
in beauty to the Friendly Islands, nor are the inhabitants less
ingenious or civilised.</p>

<p>When in latitude 44&deg; N., longitude 234&deg; 30', the long
expected coast of New Albion, so named by Sir Francis Drake, was
descried at a distance of ten leagues, and pursuing our course we
reached the inlet which is called by the natives Nootka, but
Captain Cook gave it the name of King George's Sound, where we
moored our vessels for some time. The inhabitants are short in
stature, with limbs short in proportion to the other parts; they
are wretched in appearance and lost to every idea of cleanliness.
In trafficking with us some displayed a disposition to knavery, and
the appellation of thieves is certainly applicable to them.</p>

<p>Between the promontory which the captain named Cape Douglas
after Dr. Douglas, the Dean of Windsor, and Point Banks is a large,
deep bay, which received the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span> name of Smoky Bay; and
northward he discovered more land composed of a chain of mountains,
the highest of which obtained the name of Mount St. Augustine. But
the captain was now fully convinced that no passage could be
discovered by this inlet. Steering N.E., we discovered a passage of
waves dashing against rocks; and, on tasting the water, it proved
to be a river, and not a strait, as might have been imagined. This
we traced to the latitude of 61&deg; 30' and the longitude of
210&deg;, which is upwards of 210 miles from its entrance, and saw
no appearance of its source. [Here the captain having left a blank
in his journal, which he had not filled up with any particular
name, the Earl of Sandwich very properly directed it to be called
Cook's River.] The time we spent in the discovery of Cook's River
ought not to be regretted if it should hereafter prove useful to
the present or any future age, but the delay thus occasioned was an
effectual loss to us, who had a greater object in view. The season
was far advanced, and it was now evident that the continent of
North America extended much further to the west than we had reason
to expect from the most approved charts. A bottle was buried in the
earth containing some English coins of 1772, and the point of land
was called Point Possession, being taken under the flag in the name
of His Majesty.</p>

<p>After passing Foggy Island, which we supposed from its situation
to be the island on which Behring had bestowed the same
appellation, we were followed by some natives in a canoe who sent
on board a small wooden box which contained a piece of paper in the
Russian language. To this was prefixed the date 1778, and a
reference made therein to the year 1776, from which we were
convinced that others had preceded us in visiting these dreary
regions.</p>

<p>While staying at Oonalaska we observed to the north of Cape
Prince of Wales, neither tide nor current either on the coast of
America or that of Asia. This circumstance<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> gave rise to an
opinion which some of our people entertained, that the two coasts
were connected either by land or ice, and that opinion received
some degree of strength from our never having seen any hollow waves
from the northward, and from our seeing ice almost all the way
across.</p>

<p>We were now by the captain's intention to proceed to Sandwich
Islands in order to pass a few of the winter months there, if we
should meet with the necessary refreshments, and then direct our
course to Kamtchatka in the ensuing year.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Life's Voyage Suddenly
Ended</i></div>

<p>We reached the island called by the natives Owhyhee with the
summits of its mountains covered with snow. Here an eclipse of the
moon was observed. We discovered the harbour of Karakakooa, which
we deemed a proper place for refitting the ships, our masts and
rigging having suffered much. On going ashore Captain Cook
discovered the habitation of the Society of Priests, where he was
present at some solemn ceremonies and treated with great civility.
Afterwards the captain conducted the king, Terreeoboo, on to the
ship with every mark of attention, giving him a shirt, and on our
visits afterwards on shore we trusted ourselves among the natives
without the least reserve.</p>

<p>Some time after, however, we noticed a change in their attitude.
Following a short absence in search of a better anchorage, we found
our reception very different, in a solitary and deserted bay with
hardly a friend appearing or a canoe stirring. We were told that
Terreeoboo was absent, and that the bay was tabooed. Our party on
going ashore was met by armed natives, and a scuffle arose about
the theft of some articles from the Discovery, and Pareea, our
friendly native, was, through a misunderstanding, knocked down with
an oar. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id=
"Page_110">110</a></span> Terreeoboo came and complained of
our having killed two of his people.</p>

<p>On Sunday, February 14, 1779, that memorable day, very early in
the morning, there was excitement on shore, and Captain Cook,
taking his double-barrelled gun, went ashore to seize Terreeoboo,
and keep him on board, according to his usual practice, until the
stolen boat should be returned. He ordered that every canoe should
be prevented from leaving the bay, and the captain then awoke the
old king and invited him with the mildest terms to visit the ship.
After some disputation he set out with Captain Cook, when a woman
near the waterside, the mother of the king's two boys, entreated
him to go no further, and two warriors obliged him to sit down. The
old king, filled with terror and dejection, refused to move,
notwithstanding all the persuasions of Captain Cook, who, seeing
further attempts would be risky, came to the shore. At the same
time two principal chiefs were killed on the opposite side of the
bay. A native armed with a long iron spike threatened Captain Cook,
who at last fired a charge of small shot at him, but his mat
prevented any harm. A general attack upon the marines in the boat
was made, and with fury the natives rushed upon them, dangerously
wounding several of them.</p>

<p>The last time the captain was distinctly seen he was standing at
the water's edge, ordering the boats to cease firing and pull in,
when a base assassin, coming behind him and striking him on the
head with his club, felled him to the ground, in such a direction
that he lay with his face prone to the water.</p>

<p>A general shout was set up by the islanders on seeing the
captain fall, and his body was dragged on shore, where he was
surrounded by the enemy, who, snatching daggers from each other's
hands, displayed a savage eagerness to join in his destruction. It
would seem that vengeance was directed chiefly against our captain,
by whom they supposed their king was to be<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span> dragged on board
and punished at discretion; for, having secured his body, they fled
without much regarding the rest of the slain, one of whom they
threw into the sea.</p>

<p>Thus ended the life of the greatest navigator that this or any
other nation could ever boast of, who led his crews of gallant
British seamen twice round the world, reduced to a certainty the
non-existence of a southern continent, about which the learned of
all nations were in doubt, settled the boundaries of the earth and
sea, and demonstrated the impracticability of a north-west passage
from the Atlantic to the great southern ocean, for which our ablest
geographers had contended, and in pursuit of which vast sums had
been spent in vain, and many mariners had miserably perished.</p>

<h4>WILLIAM DAMPIER</h4>

<h4>New Voyage Round the World</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Buccaneering in Southern
Seas</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>William Dampier, buccaneer and circumnavigator, was born at East
Coker, Somersetshire, England, in 1652, and died in London in
March, 1715. At sea, as a youth, he fought against the Dutch in
1673, and remained in Jamaica as a plantation overseer. Next he
became a logwood cutter on the Bay of Campeachy, and finding
himself short of wood to barter for provisions, joined the
privateers who waged piratical war on Spaniards and others, making
"many descents among the villages." Returning to England in 1678,
he sailed again in that year for Jamaica; "but it proved to be a
voyage round the world," as described in his book, and he did not
reach home till 1691. In 1698 he was given command of a ship, in
which he explored the Australian coast, but in returning was
wrecked on the Isle of Ascension. In 1711 he piloted the expedition
of Captain Woodes-Rogers which rescued Alexander Selkirk from the
Island of Juan Fernandez. The "New Voyage Round the World," which
was first published in 1697, shows Dampier to be a man of
considerable scientific knowledge, his observations of natural
history being trustworthy and accurate.</p>
</div>

<p>I first set out of England on this voyage at the beginning of
the year 1679, in the Loyal Merchant, of London, bound for Jamaica,
Captain Knapman commander. I went a passenger, designing when I
came thither to go from thence to the Bay of Campeachy, in the Gulf
of Mexico, to cut logwood. We arrived safely at Port Royal in
Jamaica, in April, 1679, and went immediately ashore. I had brought
some goods with me from England, which I intended to sell here, and
stock myself with rum and sugar, saws, axes, hats, stockings,
shoes, and such other commodities as I knew would sell among the
Campeachy logwood-cutters. About Christmas one Mr. Hobby invited me
to go a short trading voyage to<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span> the country of the
Mosquito Indians. We came to an anchor in Negril Bay, at the west
end of Jamaica; but, finding there Captains Coxon, Sawkins, Sharpe,
and other privateers, Mr. Hobby's men all left him to go with them
upon an expedition; and being thus left alone, after three or four
days' stay with Mr. Hobby, I was the more easily persuaded to go
with them too.</p>

<p>I was resolved to march by land over the Isthmus of Darien.
Accordingly, on April 5, 1680, we went ashore on the isthmus, near
Golden Island, one of the Sambaloes, to the number of between 300
and 400 men, carrying with us such provisions as were necessary,
and toys wherewith to gratify the wild Indians. In about nine days'
march we arrived at Santa Maria, and took it, and after a stay
there of about three days, we went on to the South Sea coast, and
there embarked ourselves in such canoes and periagoes as our Indian
friends furnished us withal. We were in sight of Panama on April
23, and having in vain attempted Pueblo Nuevo, before which
Sawkins, then commander-in-chief, and others, were killed, we made
some stay at the isle of Quibo.</p>

<p>About Christmas we were got as far as the isle of Juan
Fernandez, where Captain Sharpe was, by general consent, displaced
from being commander, the company being not satisfied either with
his courage or behaviour. In his stead Captain Watling was
advanced; but he being killed shortly after before Arica, where we
were repulsed with great loss, we were without a commander. Off the
island of Plata we left Captain Sharpe and those who were willing
to go with him in the ship, and embarked into our launch and
canoes. We were in number forty-four white men who bore arms; a
Spanish Indian, who bore arms also, and two Mosquito Indians, who
always have arms among the privateers, and are much valued by them
for striking fish and turtle, or tortoise, and manatee, or sea-cow;
and five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">
114</a></span> slaves taken in the South Seas, who fell to our
share. We sifted as much flour as we could well carry, and rubbed
up twenty or thirty pounds of chocolate, with sugar to sweeten it;
these things and a kettle the slaves carried on their backs after
we landed.</p>

<p>We gave out that if any man faltered in the journey overland he
must expect to be shot to death; for we knew that the Spaniards
would soon be after us, and one man falling into their hands might
well be the ruin of us all. Guided by the Indians, we finished our
journey from the South Sea to the North in twenty-three days.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Adventures with the
Privateers</i></div>

<p>It was concluded to go to a town called Coretaga (Cartagena),
and march thence on Panama. I was with Captain Archembo; but his
French seamen were the saddest creatures ever I was among. So,
meeting Captain Wright, who had taken a Spanish tartane (a
one-masted vessel) with four petereroes for stone shot, and some
long guns, we that came overland desired him to fit up his prize
and make a man-of-war of her for us. This he did, and we sailed
towards Blewfields River, where we careened our tartane.</p>

<p>While we lay here our Mosquito men went in their canoe and
struck some sea-cow. This creature is about the bigness of a horse,
and ten or twelve feet long. The mouth of it is much like the mouth
of a cow, having great thick lips. The eyes are no bigger than a
small pea; the ears are only two small holes on the side of the
head; the neck is short and thick, bigger than the head. The
biggest part of this creature is at the shoulders, where it has two
large fins, one at each side of its belly.</p>

<p>A calf that sucks is the most delicate meat; privateers commonly
roast them. The skin of the manatee is of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span> great use to
privateers, for they cut them out into straps, which they make fast
on the sides of their canoes, through which they put their oars in
rowing, instead of pegs. The skin of the bull, or of the back of
the cow, they cut into horsewhips, twisted when green, and then
hung to dry.</p>

<p>The Mosquitoes, two in a canoe, have a staff about eight feet
long, almost as big as a man's arm at the great end, where there is
a hole to place the harpoon in. At the other end is a piece of
light wood, with a hole in it, through which the small end of the
staff comes; and on this piece of bob-wood there is a line of ten
or twelve fathoms wound neatly about, the end of the line made fast
to it. The other end of the line is made fast to the harpoon, and
the Mosquito man keeps about a fathom of it loose in his hand.</p>

<p>When he strikes, the harpoon presently comes out of the staff,
and as the manatee swims away the line runs off from the bob; and
although at first both staff and bob may be carried under water,
yet as the line runs off it will rise again. When the creature's
strength is spent they haul it up to the canoe's side, knock it on
the head, and tow it ashore.</p>

<p>When we had passed by Cartagena we descried a sail off at sea and chased
her. Captain Wright, who sailed best, came up with her and engaged her;
then Captain Yanky, and they took her before we came up. We lost two or
three men, and had seven or eight wounded. The prize was a ship of
twelve guns and forty men, who had all good small arms; she was laden
with sugar and tobacco, and had eight or ten tons of marmalade on board.
We went to the Isle of Aves, where the Count d'Estr&eacute;es's whole
squadron, sent to take Cura&ccedil;oa for the French, had been wrecked.
Coming in from the eastward, the count fell in on the back of the reef,
and fired guns to give warning to the rest. But they, supposing their
admiral was engaged with enemies, crowded all sail and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116"
id= "Page_116">116</a></span> ran ashore after him, for his light in the
maintop was an unhappy beacon. The men had time enough to get ashore,
yet many perished. There were about forty Frenchmen on board one of the
ships, where there was good store of liquor. The afterpart of her broke
away and floated off to sea, with all the men drinking and singing, who,
being in drink, did not mind the danger, but were never heard of
afterwards.</p>

<p>Captain Payne, commander of a privateer of six guns, had a
pleasant accident at this island. He came hither to careen,
therefore hauled into the harbour and unrigged his ship. A Dutch
ship of twenty guns seeing a ship in the harbour, and knowing her
to be a French privateer, came within a mile of her, intending to
warp in and take her next day, for it is very narrow going in.
Captain Payne got ashore, and did in a manner conclude he must be
taken; but spied a Dutch sloop turning to get into the road, and
saw her, at the evening, anchor at the west end of the island. In
the night he sent two canoes aboard the sloop, took her, and went
away in her, making a good reprisal, and leaving his own empty ship
to the Dutchman.</p>

<p>While we lay on the Caracas coast we went ashore in some of the
bays, and took seven or eight tons of cacao; and after that three
barques, one laden with hides, the second with European
commodities, the third with earthenware and brandy. With these
three barques we went to the island of Roques, where we shared our
commodities. Twenty of us took one of the vessels, and our share of
the goods, and went directly for Virginia, where we arrived in July
1682.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;On Robinson Crusoe's
Island</i></div>

<p>I now enter upon the relation of a new voyage, proceeding from
Virginia by the way of Tierra del Fuego and the South Seas, the
East Indies, and so on, till my<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> return to England by
way of the Cape of Good Hope. On August 23, 1683, we sailed from
Achamack (Accomack), in Virginia, under the command of Captain
Cook. On February 6 we fell in with the Straits of Le Maire, and on
February 14, being in latitude 57&deg;, and to the west of Cape
Horn, we had a violent storm, which held us till March
3&mdash;thick weather all the time, with small, drizzling rain. The
nineteenth day we saw a ship, and lay muzzled to let her come up
with us, for we supposed her to be a Spanish ship. This proved to
be one Captain Eaton, from London. Both being bound for Juan
Fernandez's Isle, we kept company, and we spared him bread and
beef, and he spared us water.</p>

<p>On March 22, 1684, we came in sight of the island, and the next
day got in and anchored. We presently went ashore to seek for a
Mosquito Indian whom we left here when we were chased hence by
three Spanish ships in the year 1681, a little before we went to
Africa. This Indian lived here alone above three years. He was in
the woods hunting for goats when Captain Watling drew off his men,
and the ship was under sail before he came back to shore.</p>

<p>He had with him his gun and a knife, with a small horn of powder
and a few shot. These being spent, he contrived a way, by notching
his knife, to saw the barrel of his gun into small pieces,
wherewith he made harpoons, lances, hooks, and a long knife;
heating the pieces first in the fire, which he struck with his
gun-flint, and a piece of the barrel of his gun, which he hardened,
having learnt to do that among the English. The hot pieces of iron
he would hammer out and bend as he pleased with stones, and saw
them with his jagged knife, or grind them to an edge by long
labour, and harden them to a good temper as there was occasion.
With such instruments as he made in that manner he got such
provision as the island afforded, either goats or fish. He told us
that at first he was forced to eat seal,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> which is very
ordinary meat, before he had made hooks; but afterwards he never
killed any seals but to make lines, cutting their skins into
thongs.</p>

<p>He had, half a mile from the sea, a little house or hut, which
was lined with goatskin. His couch, or barbecue of sticks, lying
along about two feet distant from the ground, was spread with the
same, as was all his bedding. He had no clothes left, having worn
out all those he brought from Watling's ship, but only a skin about
his waist. He saw our ship the day before we came to an anchor, and
did believe we were English, and therefore killed three goats in
the morning before we came to anchor, and dressed them with cabbage
to treat us when we came ashore.</p>

<p>This island is about twelve leagues round, full of high hills
and small, pleasant valleys, which, if manured, would probably
produce anything proper for the climate. The sides of the mountains
are part woodland and part savannahs, well stocked with wild goats
descended from those left here by Juan Fernandez in his voyage from
Lima to Valdivia. Seals swarm as thick about this island as though
they had no other place to live in, for there is not a bay nor rock
that one can get ashore on but is full of them. They are as big as
calves, the head of them like a dog, therefore called by the Dutch
sea-hounds. Here are always thousands&mdash;I might say
millions&mdash;of them sitting on the bays, or going and coming in
the sea round the island. When they come out of the sea they bleat
like sheep for their young, and though they pass through hundreds
of other young ones before they come to their own, yet they will
not suffer any of them to suck. A blow on the nose soon kills them.
Large ships might here load themselves with sealskins and
train-oil, for they are extraordinary fat.</p>

<p>Our passage lay now along the Pacific Sea. We made the best of
our way towards the line, and fell in with the mainland of South
America. The land is of a most<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> prodigious height. It
lies generally in ridges parallel to the shore, three or four
ridges one within another, each surpassing the other in height.
They always appear blue when seen at sea; sometimes they are
obscured with clouds, but not so often as the high lands in other
parts of the world&mdash;for there are seldom or never any rains on
these hills, nor are they subject to fogs. These are the highest
mountains that ever I saw, far surpassing the peak of Teneriffe, or
Santa Marta, and, I believe, any mountains in the world.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;More Buccaneering
Exploits</i></div>

<p>On May 3 we descried a sail. Captain Eaton, being ahead, soon
took her; she was laden with timber. Near the island of Lobos we
chased and caught three sail, all laden with flour. In the biggest
was a letter from the viceroy of Lima to the president of Panama,
assuring him there were enemies in that sea, for which reason he
had despatched this flour, and desiring him to be frugal of it, for
he knew not when he should send more. In this ship were likewise
seven or eight tons of marmalade of quinces, and a stately mule
sent to the president, and a very large image of the Virgin Mary in
wood, carved and painted, to adorn a new church at Panama. She
brought also from Lima 800,000 pieces of eight to carry with her to
Panama; but while she lay at Huanchaco, taking in her lading of
flour, the merchants, hearing of Captain Swan's being at Valdivia
ordered the money ashore again.</p>

<p>On September 20 we came to the island of Plata, so named, as
some report, after Sir Francis Drake took the Cacafuego&mdash;a
ship chiefly laden with plate, which they say he brought hither and
divided with his men. Near it we took an Indian village called
Manta, but found no sort of provision, the viceroy having sent
orders to all seaports to keep none, but just to supply
themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id=
"Page_120">120</a></span> At La Plata arrived Captain Swan, in
the Cygnet, of London. He was fitted out by very eminent merchants
of that city on a design only to trade with Spaniards or Indians;
but, meeting with divers disappointments, and being out of hopes to
obtain a trade in these seas, his men forced him to entertain a
company of privateers, who had come overland under the command of
Captain Peter Harris. Captains Davis and Swan sent our small barque
to look for Captain Eaton, the isle of Plata to be the general
rendezvous; and on November 2 we landed 110 men to take the small
Spanish seaport town of Payta. The governor of Piura had come the
night before to Payta with a hundred armed men to oppose our
landing, but our men marched directly to the fort and took it
without the loss of one man, whereupon the governor of Piura, with
all his men, and the inhabitants of the town, ran away as fast as
they could. Then our men entered the town, and found it emptied
both of money and goods. There was not so much as a meal of
victuals left for them. We anchored before the town, and stayed
till the sixth day in hopes to get a ransom. Our captains demanded
300 packs of flour, 300 lb. of sugar, twenty-five jars of wine, and
a thousand jars of water, but we got nothing of it. Therefore
Captain Swan ordered the town to be fired.</p>

<p>Once in three years the Spanish Armada comes to Porto Bello,
then the Plate Fleet also from Lima comes hither with the king's
treasure, and abundance of merchant ships, full of goods and plate.
With other privateers we formed the plan, in 1685, of attacking the
Armada and capturing the treasure. On May 28 we saw the Spanish
fleet three leagues from the island of Pacheque&mdash;in all
fourteen sail, besides periagoes. Our fleet consisted of but ten
sail. Yet we were not discouraged, but resolved to fight them, for
being to windward, we had it in our choice whether we would fight
or not. We bore down right afore the wind upon our<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
enemies, but night came on without anything besides the exchanging
of a few shot. When it grew dark the Spanish admiral put out a
light as a signal to his fleet to anchor. We saw the light in the
admiral's top about half an hour, and then it was taken down. In a
short time after we saw the light again, and being to windward, we
kept under sail, supposing the light to have been in the admiral's
top.</p>

<p>But, as it proved, this was only a stratagem of theirs, for this
light was put out a second time at one of their barques' topmast
head, and then she went to leeward, which deceived us. In the
morning, therefore, contrary to our expectations, we found they had
got the weather-gauge of us, and were coming upon us with full
sail. So we ran for it, and after a running fight all day, were
glad to escape. Thus ended this day's work, and with it all that we
had been projecting for four or five months.</p>

<p>The town of Puebla Nueva was taken with 150 men, and in July,
being 640 men in eight sail of ships, we designed to attempt the
city of Leon. We landed 470 men to march to the town, and I was
left to guard the canoes till their return. With eighty men Captain
Townley entered the town, and was briskly charged in a broad street
by 170 or 200 Spanish horsemen; but two or three of their leaders
being knocked down, the rest fled. The Spaniards talked of ransom,
but only to gain time to get more men. Our captains therefore set
the city on fire, and came away.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;Home by the East Indies</i></div>

<p>Afterwards we steered for the coast of California, and some of
us taking the resolution of going over to the East Indies, we set
out from Cape Corrientes on March 31, 1686. We were two ships in
company, Captain Swan's ship, and a barque commanded under Captain
Swan by Captain Tait, and we were 150 men&mdash;100<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
aboard of the ship, and 50 aboard the barque, besides slaves. It
was very strange that in all the voyage to Guam, in the Ladrones,
we did not see one fish, not so much as a flying fish.</p>

<p>From Guam we went to Mindanao in the Philippines. About this
time some of our men, who were weary and tired with wandering, ran
away into the country. The whole crew were under a general
disaffection, and full of different projects, and all for want of
action. One day that Captain Swan was ashore, a Bristol man named
John Reed peeped into his journal and lighted on a place where
Captain Swan had inveighed bitterly against most of his men.
Captain Tait, who had been abused by Captain Swan, laid hold of
this opportunity to be revenged. So we left Captain Swan and about
thirty-six men ashore in the city, and sailed from Mindanao. Among
the Pescadores we had a storm in which the violent wind raised the
sea to a great height; the rain poured down as through a sieve; it
thundered and lightened prodigiously, and the sea seemed all of a
fire about us. I was never in such a violent storm in all my life;
so said all the company. Afterwards we came to Grafton and Monmouth
islands, the island of Celebes, and others.</p>

<p>Being clear of all the islands, we stood off south, and on
January 4, 1688, we fell in with the land of New Holland, a part of
Terra Australis Incognita. It is not yet determined whether it is
an island or a main continent, but I am certain that it does not
join Asia, Africa, or America.</p>

<p>We sailed from New Holland to Sumatra and the Nicobar Islands,
where, being anxious to escape from the ship, I desired Captain
Reed to set me ashore. Mr. Robert Hall, and a man named Ambrose,
whose surname I have forgot, were put ashore with me. From the
Nicobar people we bought for an axe a canoe, in which we stowed our
chests and clothes, and in this frail craft<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span> we three
Englishmen, with four Malays and a mongrel Portuguese, made our way
to Achin. The hardships of this voyage, with the scorching heat of
the sun at our first setting out, and then the cold rain in a
fearful storm, cast us all into fevers. Three days after our
arrival our Portuguese died. What became of our Malays I know not.
Ambrose lived not long after.</p>

<p>In January, 1691, there came to an anchor in Bencouli Road the
Defence, Captain Heath commander, bound for England. On this ship I
obtained a passage to England, where we arrived on September 16,
1691.</p>

<h4>CHARLES DARWIN</h4>

<h4>The Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;To the South American
Coast</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The "Journal of Researches into the Natural History and Geology
of the Countries Visited during the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle Round
the World" was Darwin's first popular contribution to travel and
science. His original journal of the part he took in the
expedition, as naturalist of the surveying ships Adventure and
Beagle, was published, together with the official narratives of
Captains Fitzroy and King, a year after the return of the latter
vessel to England in October, 1836. It was not till 1845 that
Darwin issued his independent book, of which the following is an
epitome, written from the notes in his journal. It immediately
attracted considerable popular and scientific attention, and many
editions and cheap reprints have been issued during the past half
century. It is said that Darwin at first considered himself more as
a collector than as a scientific worker; but experience soon
brought to him the keen enjoyment of the original investigator. The
most striking feature of the book is the combined minuteness and
breadth of his observations and descriptions. There can be no doubt
that it was the gathered results of his discoveries, and the study
of his collected specimens of the zoology, botany, and geology of
the countries visited; his graphic presentation of their physical
geography; and their synthetic analysis, which laid the foundations
of his great generalisations of the "Origin of Species." (See <span
class="smcap">Science</span>.)</p>
</div>

<p>After having been twice driven back by heavy south-west gales,
H.M.S. Beagle, a ten-gun brig, under the command of Captain
Fitzroy, R.N., sailed from Devonport on December 27, 1831. The
object of the expedition was to complete the survey of Patagonia
and Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826-30; to
survey the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some of the islands in the
Pacific; and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round
the world.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">
125</a></span> On January 16, 1832, we touched at Porto Praya, St.
Jago, in the Cape de Verde archipelago, and sailed thence to Rio de
Janeiro, Brazil. Delight is a weak term to express the higher
feelings of wonder, astonishment, and devotion which fill the mind
of a naturalist in wandering through the Brazilian tropical forest.
The noise from the insects is so loud that it may be heard at sea
several hundred yards from the shore, yet within the recesses of
the forest a universal silence seems to reign. The wonderful and
beautiful flowering parasites invariably struck me as the most
novel object in these grand scenes. Among the cabbage-palms, waving
their elegant heads fifty feet from the ground, were woody
creepers, two feet in circumference, themselves covered by other
creepers.</p>

<p>The humming birds are fond of shady spots, and these little
creatures, with their brilliant plumage, buzzing round the flowers
with wings vibrating so rapidly as scarcely to be visible, seek the
tiny insects in the calyx rather than the fabled honey. Insects are
particularly numerous, the bees excepted. The Beagle was employed
surveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of America south
of the Plata during the two succeeding years. The almost entire
absence of trees in the pampas of Uruguay, the provinces of Buenos
Ayres [now Argentina], and Patagonia is remarkable.</p>

<p>Fifteen miles from the Rio Negro, the principal river on the
whole line of coast between the Strait of Magellan and the Plata,
are several shallow lakes of brine in winter, which in summer are
converted into fields of snow-white salt two and a half miles long
and one broad. The border of the lakes is formed of mud, which is
thrown up by a kind of worm. How surprising it is that any creature
should be able to exist in brine, and that they should be crawling
among crystals of sulphate of soda and lime!</p>

<p>The valley of the Rio Negro, broad as it is, has merely<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">
126</a></span> been excavated out of the sandstone plain; and
everywhere the landscape wears the same sterile aspect.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Fossil Monsters of the
Pampas</i></div>

<p>The pampas are formed from the mud, gravel, and sand thrown up
by the sea during the slow elevation of the land; and the section
disclosed at Punta Alta, a few miles from Bahia Blanca, was
interesting from the number and extraordinary character of the
remains of gigantic land animals embedded in it. I also found
remains of immense armadillo-like animals on the banks of a
tributary of the Rio Negro; and, indeed, I believe that the whole
area of the pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct colossal
quadrupeds. The following, which I unearthed, are now deposited in
the College of Surgeons, London.</p>

<p>(1) Head and bones of a <i>megatherium</i>, the huge dimensions
of which are expressed by its name; (2) the <i>megalonyx</i>, a
great allied animal; (3) the perfect skeleton of a
<i>scelidorium</i>, also an allied animal, as large as a
rhinoceros, in structure like the Cape ant-eater, but in some other
respects approaching the armadilloes; (4) the <i>mylodon
Darwinii</i>, a closely related genus, and little inferior in size;
(5) another gigantic dental quadruped; (6) another large animal
very like an armadillo; (7) an extinct kind of horse (it is a
marvellous fact in the history of the mammalia that, in South
America, a native horse should have lived and disappeared, to be
succeeded in after ages by the countless herds descended from the
few introduced with the Spanish colonists); (8) a pachydermatous
animal, a huge beast with a long neck like a camel; (9) the
toxodon, perhaps the strangest animal ever discovered; in size it
equalled an elephant, or <i>megatherium</i>, but was intimately
related to the Gnawers, the order which at the present day includes
most of the smallest quadrupeds; and judging from<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span> the
position of the eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably
aquatic.</p>

<p>We have good evidence that these gigantic quadrupeds, more
different from those of the present day than the oldest of the
Tertiary quadrupeds of Europe, lived whilst the sea was peopled
with most of its present inhabitants. These animals migrated on
land, since submerged, near Behring's Strait, from Siberia into
North America, and thence on land, since submerged, in the West
Indies into South America, where they mingled with the forms
characteristic of that southern continent, and have since become
extinct.</p>

<p>The existing animals of the pampas include the puma, the South
American lion, while the birds are numerous. The largest is the
ostrich, which is found in groups. The ostriches are fleet in pace,
prefer running against the wind, and freely take to the water. At
first start they expand their wings, and, like a vessel, make all
sail. Of mammalia, the jaguar, or South American tiger, is the most
formidable. It frequents the wooded and reedy banks of the great
rivers. There are four species of armadilloes, notable for their
smooth, hard, defensive covering. Of reptiles there are many kinds.
One snake, a <i>trigonocephalus</i>, has in some respects the
structure of a viper with the habits of a rattlesnake. The
expression of this snake's face is hideous and fierce. I do not
think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting, perhaps, some of
the viper-bats.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;In the Extreme South</i></div>

<p>From the Rio Plata the course of the Beagle was directed to the
mouth of the Santa Cruz river, on the coast of Patagonia. One
evening, when we were about ten miles from the bay of San Blas,
vast numbers of butterflies, in bands and flocks of countless
myriads, extended as far as the eye could range. One dark night,
with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">
128</a></span> fresh breeze, the foam and every part of the
surface of the waves glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove
before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake
she was followed by a milky train. I am inclined to consider that
the phosphorescence is the result of organic particles, by which
process (one is tempted almost to call it a kind of respiration)
the ocean becomes purified.</p>

<p>The geology of Patagonia is interesting. For hundreds of miles
of coast there is one great deposit composed of shells&mdash;a
white pumiceous stone like chalk, including gypsum and
<i>infusoria</i>. At Port St. Julian it is eight hundred feet
thick, and is capped by a mass of gravel forming probably one of
the largest beds of shingle in the world, extending to the foot of
the Cordilleras. For 1,200 miles from the Rio Plata to Tierra del
Fuego the land has been raised by many hundred feet, and the
uprising movement has been interrupted by at least eight long
periods of rest, during which the sea ate deep back into the land,
forming at successive levels the long lines of cliffs, or
escarpments, which separate the different plains as they rise like
steps one behind the other. What a history of geological change
does the simply constructed coast of Patagonia reveal! In some red
mud, capping the gravel, I discovered fossil bones which showed the
wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and
the living, and will, I have no doubt, hereafter throw more light
on the appearance of organic beings on our earth and their
disappearance from it than any other class of facts. Patagonia is
sterile, but is possessed of a greater stock of rodents than any
other country in the world. The principal animals are the llamas,
in herds up to 500, and the puma, which, with the condor and other
carrion hawks, preys upon them.</p>

<p>From the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle twice made a compass of
the Falkland Islands, and archipelago in<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> nearly the same
latitude. It is a delicate and wretched land, everywhere covered by
a peaty soil and wiry grass of one monotonous colour. The only
native quadruped is a large wolf-like fox, which will soon be as
extinct as the dodo. The birds embrace enormous numbers of
sea-fowl, especially geese and penguins. The wings of a great
logger-headed duck called the "steamer" are too weak for flight;
but, by their aid, partly by swimming, partly flapping, they move
very quickly. Thus we found in South America three birds who use
their wings for other purposes besides flight&mdash;the penguins as
fins, the "steamers" as paddles, and the ostrich as sails.</p>

<p>Tierra del Fuego may be described as a mountainous land,
separated from the South American continent by the Strait of
Magellan, partly submerged in the sea, so that deep inlets and bays
occupy the place where valleys should exist. The mountain-sides,
except on the exposed western coasts, are covered from the water's
edge upwards to the perpetual snow-line by one great forest,
chiefly of beeches. Viewing the stunted natives on the west coast,
one can hardly conceive that they are fellow-creatures and
inhabitants of the same world; and I believe that in this extreme
part of South America man exists in a lower state of improvement
than in any other part of the globe. The zoology of Tierra del
Fuego is very poor. In the gloomy woods there are few birds, but
where flowers grow there are humming birds, a few parrots and
insects, but no reptiles.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Wonders of the
Cordilleras</i></div>

<p>After encountering many adventures in these Antarctic seas,
among which was a narrow escape from shipwreck in a fierce gale
off Cape Horn, and amidst hitherto unexplored Antarctic islands,
the Beagle set a course northward in the open Pacific for
Valparaiso, the chief seaport of Chile, which was reached on July
23, 1834.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">
130</a></span> Chile is a narrow strip of land between the
Cordilleras and the Pacific, and this strip itself is traversed by
many mountain lines which run parallel to the great range. Between
these outer lines and the main Cordilleras a succession of level
basins, generally opening into each other by narrow passages,
extend far to the southward. These basins, no doubt, are the
bottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays such as at the present day
intersect every part of Tierra del Fuego.</p>

<p>From November, 1834, to March, 1835, the Beagle was employed in
surveying the island of Chiloe and the broken line called the
Chonos Archipelago. This archipelago is covered by one dense
forest, resembling that of Tierra del Fuego, but incomparably more
beautiful. There are few parts of the world within the temperate
regions where so much rain falls. The winds are very boisterous,
and the sky almost always clouded. Fortunately, for once, while we
were on the east side of Chiloe the day rose splendidly clear, and
we could see the great range of the Andes on the mainland with
three active volcanoes, each 7,000 feet high.</p>

<p>While at Valdivia, on the mainland, on February 20, 1835, the
worst earthquake ever recorded in Chile occurred, and it was
followed for twelve days by no less than 300 tremblings. A bad
earthquake at once destroys our oldest associations; the earth, the
very emblem of solidity, has moved beneath our feet like a thin
crust over a fluid. One second of time has created in the mind a
strange idea of insecurity which hours of reflection would not have
produced. The most remarkable effect was the permanent elevation of
the land round the Bay of Concepcion by several feet. The
convulsion was more effectual in lessening the size of the island
of Quiriquina off the coast than the ordinary wear and tear of the
sea and weather during the course of a whole century; but on the
other hand, on the Island of St. Maria putrid mussel-shells, still
adhering to the rocks, were found ten<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span> feet above high-water
mark. Near Juan Fernandez Island a volcano uprose from under the
water close to the shore, and at the same instant two volcanoes in
the far-off Cordilleras bust forth into action.</p>

<p>The space from which volcanic matter was actually erupted is 720
miles in one line and 400 miles in another line at right-angles
from the first; hence, in all probability, a subterranean lake of
lava is here stretched out of nearly double the area of the Black
Sea. The frequent quakings of the earth on this line of coast are
caused, I believe, by the rending of the strata, necessarily
consequent on the tension of the land when upraised, and their
injection by fluidified rock. This rending and injection would, if
repeated often enough, form a chain of hills.</p>

<p>I made the passage of the Cordilleras to Mendoza, the capital of
the republic of that name, on horseback. The features in the
scenery of the Andes which struck me most were that all the main
valleys have on both sides a fringe, sometimes expanding into a
narrow plain of shingle and sand. I am convinced that these shingle
terraces were accumulated during the gradual elevation of the
Cordilleras by the torrents delivering at successive levels their
detritus on the beach-heads of long, narrow arms of the sea, first
high up the valleys, then lower down and lower down as the land
slowly rose.</p>

<p>If this be so, and I cannot doubt it, the grand and broken chain
of the Cordilleras, instead of having been suddenly thrown
up&mdash;as was till lately the universal, and still is the common,
opinion of geologists&mdash;has been slowly upheaved in mass in the
same gradual manner as the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific have
arisen within the recent period. The other striking features of the
Cordilleras were the bright colours, chiefly red and purple, of the
utterly bare and precipitous hills of porphyry; the grand and
continuous wall-like dikes; the plainly divided strata, which,
where nearly vertical,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id=
"Page_132">132</a></span> formed the picturesque and wild
central pinnacles, but where less inclined composed the great
massive mountains on the outskirts of the range; and lastly, the
smooth, conical piles of fine and brightly-coloured detritus, which
slope up sometimes to a height of more than 2,000 feet.</p>

<p>It is an old story, but not less wonderful, to see shells which
were once crawling at the bottom of the sea now standing nearly
14,000 feet above its level. But there must have been a subsidence
of several thousand feet as well as the ensuing elevation. Daily it
is forced home on the mind of the geologist that nothing, not even
the wind that blows, is so unstable as the level of the crust of
the earth.</p>

<p>From Valparaiso to Coquimbo, and thence to Copiapo, in Northern
Chile, the country is singularly broken and barren. On some of the
terraced plains rising to the Cordilleras, covered with cacti,
there were large herds of llamas. At one point in the coast range
great prostrate silicified trunks of fir trees were very numerous,
embedded in a conglomerate. I discovered convincing proof that this
part of the continent of South America has been elevated near the
coast from 400 feet to 1,300 feet since the epoch of existing
shells; and further inland the rise possibly may have been greater.
From the evidence of ruins of Indian villages at very great
altitude, now absolutely barren, and some fossil human relics, man
must have inhabited South America for an immensely long period.</p>

<p>From the port of Iquique, in Peru, a visit was made across the
desert to the nitrate of soda mines. The nitrate stratum, between
two and three feet thick, lies close to the surface, and follows
for 150 miles the margin of the plain. From the troubled state of
the country, I saw very little of the rest of Peru.</p>

<p>A month was spent in the Galapagos Archipelago&mdash;a group of
volcanic islands situated on the Equator between<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
500 and 600 miles westward of the coast of America. The little
archipelago is a little world within itself. Hence, both in time
and space, we seemed to be brought somewhere near to that great
fact, that mystery of mysteries, the first appearance of new beings
on this earth. The vegetation is scanty. The principal animals are
the giant tortoises, so large that it requires six or eight men to
lift one. The most remarkable feature of the natural history of
this archipelago is that the different islands are inhabited by
different kinds of tortoises; and so with the birds, insects, and
plants. One is astonished at the amount of creative force, if such
an expression may be used, displayed on these small, barren, and
rocky islands, and still more so at its diverse, yet analogous,
action on points so near each other.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;The Coral Islands of the Indian
Ocean</i></div>

<p>Having completed the survey of the coasts and islands of the
South American continent, the Beagle sailed across the wide Pacific
to Tahiti, New Zealand, and Australia, in order to carry out the
chain of chronometrical measurements round the world. From
Australasia a run was then made for Keeling or Cocos Island in the
Indian Ocean. This lonely island, 600 miles from the coast of
Sumatra, is an atoll, or lagoon island. The land is entirely
composed of fragments of coral.</p>

<p>There is, to my mind, much grandeur in the view of the outer
shores of these lagoon islands. The ocean, throwing its waters over
the broad barrier-like reef, appears an invincible, all-powerful
enemy. Yet these low, insignificant coral islets stand and are
victorious; for here another power, as an antagonist, takes part in
the contest. Organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of
lime, one by one, from the foaming breakers, and unite them in a
symmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge
fragments, yet what will that<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> tell against the
accumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day,
month after month?</p>

<p>There are three great classes of coral reefs&mdash;atoll,
barrier, and fringing. Now, the utmost depth at which corals can
construct reefs is between twenty and thirty fathoms, so that
wherever there is an atoll a foundation must have originally
existed within a depth of from twenty to thirty fathoms from the
surface. The coral formation is raised only to that height to which
the waves can throw up fragments and the winds pile up sand. The
foundation, such as a mountain peak, therefore, must have sunk to
the required level, and not have been raised, as has hitherto been
generally supposed.</p>

<p>I venture, therefore, to affirm that, on the theory of the
upward growth of the corals during the sinking of the land, all the
leading features of those wonderful structures, the lagoon-islands
or atolls, as well as the no less wonderful barrier-reefs, whether
encircling small islands, or stretching for hundreds of miles along
the shores of a continent, are simply explained. On the other hand,
coasts merely fringed by reefs cannot have subsided to any
perceptible amount, and therefore they must, since the growth of
their corals, either have remained stationary or have been
upheaved.</p>

<p>The chronometrical measurements were completed in the Indian
Ocean by a visit to Mauritius, and thence, voyaging around the Cape
of Good Hope, to the islands of St. Helena and Ascension, in the
Southern Atlantic, and to the mainland of Brazil at Bahia and
Pernambuco, from which the course was set for home. The Beagle made
the shores of England at Falmouth on October 2, 1836, after an
absence of nearly five years.</p>

<p>On a retrospect, among the scenes which are deeply impressed on
my mind, including the spectacles of the Southern Cross, the Cloud
of Magellan, and the other constellations of the Southern
Hemisphere, the glacier leading its blue stream of ice overhanging
the sea in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">135</a></span> bold precipice, the lagoon-islands
raised by the reef-building corals, the active volcano, the
overwhelming effects of a violent earthquake&mdash;none exceed in
sublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man,
whether those of Brazil, where the powers of Life are predominant,
or those of Tierra del Fuego, where Death and Decay prevail. Both
are temples filled with the varied productions of the God of
nature. No one can stand in those solitudes unmoved and not feel
that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body. And so
with the boundless plains of Patagonia, or when looking from the
highest crest of the Cordilleras, the mind is filled with the
stupendous dimensions of the surrounding masses.</p>

<h4>FELIX DUBOIS</h4>

<h4>Timbuctoo the Mysterious</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;From Paris to the Niger</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Felix Dubois has a considerable reputation in France and on the
European Continent generally as an African explorer. His sphere of
travel has been confined to the Dark Continent north of the
Equator. He first published in 1894 "Life on the Black Continent,"
but his reputation rests mainly on "Timbuctoo the Mysterious,"
issued in 1897, of which two English translations have appeared.
Dubois' style is vivacious and picturesque, with a vein of poetic
feeling in some passages. His "Early History of Northern Africa and
Timbuctoo," of the architecture of which he has made a special
study, is lucid; but in discussing the extension of the British and
French spheres of influence and protectorates during the past
century he betrays a certain measure of Gallic Anglophobia.</p>
</div>

<p>Having fallen asleep in a railway carriage on your departure
from Paris, you awake six weeks later on a canoe-barge upon the
Niger. The steamer lands you at the entrance to the Senegal, in a
country which has belonged to France for centuries. The port of
Senegal is Dakar, the finest harbour on the west coast of Africa,
and from thence there is a railway to St. Louis. For eight days you
travel up the Senegal river in a steamer to Kayes, the port and
actual capital of the Sudan; and a narrow-gauge railway carries you
from the Senegal to the Niger at Dioubaba.</p>

<p>This town is situated in the heart of lovely mountain and river
scenery. The Bakoy river here breaks into a rocky waterfall, some
hundreds of yards in length, full of rapids and foaming currents.
The horizon is bordered by mountain-tops, and the river banks are
covered by gigantic trees festooned with garlands of long creepers.
The road from Dioubaba to Bammaku cuts,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span> from east to
west, the massive Foota Jallon range that separates the basin of
the Senegal from that of the Niger, and is so abundantly watered
that you fall asleep every night to the sound of some gurgling
cascade.</p>

<p>It was not without a certain amount of emotion that I approached
the great Niger. After days and days of travel a narrow path widens
suddenly, and its rocky sides fall right and left, like the leaves
of a door. A vast horizon lies at my feet, bathed in the splendours
of a tropical sunset; and down there, in a plain of gold and green
and red, shines a silver trail bordered by a line of darkness.</p>

<p>The Niger, with its vast and misty horizons, is more like an
inland ocean than a river. I engaged for my voyage up-stream a boat
which was a whimsical mixture of a European barge and an aboriginal
canoe, in which a thatched hollow served me amidships as bedroom,
dining-room, study, and dressing-room. A small folding bedstead was
the only piece of furniture. The crew consisted of Bosos, the true
sailors of the Niger, of whose skill, patient endurance, and
loyalty I had full experience. Alone among them, travelling through
an imperfectly conquered, sometimes openly hostile country, never
once did I feel that my safety was in any way threatened.</p>

<p>Coming to Lake Debo, a fief of the Niger, we enter a sea of
grass. Paddling being no longer possible, my Bosos crew, leaning
heavily upon bamboo poles, push the boat vigorously through the
grass, which, parting in front, closes together behind us with loud
rustling and crackling. We are no longer upon the water, but seem
to be sliding under a tropical sun over grassy steppes streaked
with watery paths. These Bosos, living at a distance of nearly 900
miles from the coast, possess no idea of the sea, and the question
of what becomes of the mighty Niger beyond the regions they know
troubles them very little. One unusually intelligent Bosos,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">
138</a></span> when asked what became of the river beyond the
towns which he knew, or had heard of, down the Niger, said, "Beyond
them? Oh, beyond them the fishes swallow it."</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Valley of the Niger</i></div>

<p>The country lying to the south of Timbuctoo, which is on the
threshold of the great Sahara desert, is the Sudan, otherwise
called the Valley and the Buckler of the Niger. It is a vast region
traversed to an extent of nearly 2,500 miles by one of the largest
rivers in the world. This river rises in the Kouranko chain of
mountains, and is really formed by two streams, the Paliko and the
Tembi, which unite at a place called Laya. The more important of
these is the Tembi, and the wood from which it springs is reputed
sacred, and is the subject of innumerable legends and
superstitions. Access to it is denied to the profane by the high
priests and lesser priests, who represent the diety to mortals. The
neighbouring kinglets refer to them before undertaking a war, or
other act of importance, and the common herd consult them on all
occasions of weight. The spirit of the spring, being eminently
practical, will only condescend to attend to them through the
medium of sacrifice, but the ceremonies are not very ferocious,
merely oxen being offered, and not human victims, as in the
neighbouring Dahomey.</p>

<p>The region of the source of the Niger is the land of heavy
rainfall, and the slopes of the mountain ranges are channelled by
innumerable cascades, rivulets, brooks, and rivers that carry off
the heavenly overflow. These countries of the Upper Niger are
radiant. Tropical vegetation spreads over them with the utmost
prodigality. The river flings itself headlong over the entire
low-lying region between Biafaraba and Timbuctoo, covering it and
swamping it, until a steppe of barren sand becomes one of the most
fertile spots in the universe.<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span> The Niger is to the
Sudan what the Nile is to Egypt; but we find there not one delta,
as in Egypt, but three. Thus a most complete system of irrigation
is formed, and fertility is spread over thousands of square miles.
The rise and fall of the waters is as regular as that of the Nile,
and an infinitely greater distance is covered.</p>

<p>Bammaku is an important strategic centre, from which it is easy
to send reinforcements to any part of the Sudan that may be
momentarily threatened. This precaution is wise, for we do not
really know how far we are masters of this splendid country, which
is many times larger than France, and contains from ten to fifteen
millions of people. There are only 600 Europeans, including
officers and other officials, and 4,000 negroes are enrolled as
foot-soldiers, cavalry, and transport bearers, while it requires an
army of 40,000 men to maintain order in Algeria, about a fourth of
the size of the Sudan.</p>

<p>Apart from the fertility of the soil for cereal crops, there are
three kinds of trees which grow abundantly everywhere. The most
interesting is the karita, or butter-tree, from the nuts of which a
vegetable butter is extracted with all the delectable flavour of
chocolate. Throughout the whole of the Sudan no other fatty
substance is used. The second tree is the flour tree. The flour is
enclosed in large pods, is of a yellow colour, rich in sugar, and
is used in the manufacture of pastry and confectionery. The third
is the cheese-tree, called <i>baga</i> by the natives, from the
capsules of which a fine and brilliant vegetable silk is yielded.
The principal articles of commerce sent by Bammaku to Timbuctoo are
the products of these trees, gold, and kola-nuts.</p>

<p>In the voyage up the river beyond Bammaku we passed the
districts in which the principal towns are Nyamina, Sansanding, and
Segu, in which are the large cotton-fields, from the produce of
which the beautiful fabrics known as <i>pagnes de Segu</i> are
made, which are in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">140</a></span> great request in Senegal and the
markets of Timbuctoo. Near Segu is an establishment known as the
School of Hostages, instituted by the explorer Faidherbe for the
education of the sons of kings and chiefs of Senegambia, to enable
them to take part in home government, or to enter the civil and
military services of Senegal and Sudan.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;The Jewel of the Niger
Valley</i></div>

<p>Jenne is the jewel of the valley of the Niger. A vast plain,
infinitely flat. In the midst of this a circle of water, and within
it reared a long mass of high and regular walls, erected on mounds
as high, and nearly as steep, as themselves. When I climbed the
banks from my boat and entered the walls, I was completely
bewildered by the novelty and strangeness of the town's interior.
Regular streets; wide, straight roads; well-built houses of two
stories instantly arrested the eye. But the buildings had nothing
in common with Arabic architecture. The style was not Byzantine,
Roman, or Greek; still less was it Gothic or Western. It was in the
ruins of the lifeless towns of ancient Egypt, in the valley of the
Nile, that I had witnessed this art before. Arrived at Jenne, the
traveller finds himself face to face with an entirely new
ethnographical entity&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the Songhois.</p>

<p>They themselves invariably told me that they came originally
from the Yemen to Egypt on the invitation of a Pharaoh, and settled
at Kokia, in the valley of the Nile, whence they spread westward to
the Niger in the middle of the seventh century. They built Jenne in
765, made it the market of their country, and founded the Songhois
Empire, which, under three distinct dynasties, lasted for a
thousand years.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century a marvellous civilisation appeared in
the very heart of the Black Continent. The prosperity of the Sudan,
and its wealth and commerce,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span> were known far and
wide. Caravans returning to the coast proclaimed its splendours in
their camel-loads of gold, ivory, hides, musk, and the spoils of
the ostrich. So many attractions did not fail to rouse the cupidity
of neighbouring territories, chief among them being Morocco. El
Mansour, sultan of Morocco, invaded the Sudan in 1590, and in a few
years the fall of the Songhois Empire was complete. Two elements of
confusion established themselves, and augmented the general
anarchy&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, the Touaregs and the Foulbes, the former
coming from the great desert of Sahara, and the latter from the
west. Both were pastoral nomads. A petty Foulbe chief, of the
country of Noukouna, named Ahmadou, spread a report that he was of
the family of the Prophet, and for the next eighty years the Sudan
was given over to fire and sword by a succession of rulers who
massacred and pillaged in the name of God. Jenne happily escaped
serious ruin, because of its situation on an island at the junction
of two tributaries of the Niger.</p>

<p>The houses of Jenne are built on the simple lines of Egyptian
architecture, with splendid bricks made from clay procured near the
town. The grand mosque was long famous in the valley of the Niger,
and was considered more beautiful than the Kaabah of Mecca itself.
It lasted eighteen centuries, and would have lasted many centuries
longer if Ahmadou, the Foulbe conquerer, had not commanded its
destruction in 1830. Jenne in the middle ages not only ranked above
Timbuctoo as a city, but took a place among the great commercial
centres of Islam. Jenne taught the Sudanese the art of commercial
navigation, and her fleets penetrated beyond Timbuctoo and the Kong
country. Regular lines of flyboats even now carry merchandise and
passengers at a fixed tariff, and for a consideration of two and a
half francs you can go to Timbuctoo, a twenty days' journey, and
for three francs can send thither a hundredweight of goods.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">
142</a></span> The characteristics of the people are sympathy,
kindness, and generosity.</p>

<p>Here trades are specialised. Conformably with, and contrary to,
Arab usage, it is the men who weave the textiles, and not the
women. The latter do the spinning and the dyeing. Masonry is man's
work&mdash;in negro countries it is the women who build the
houses&mdash;and in the blacksmith's and other trades the craft
descends from father to son.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Timbuctoo, Queen of the
Sudan</i></div>

<p>The day of my departure from Jenne was occupied in receiving
farewell visits from scores of friends, who first believed me a
harmless lunatic as "the man with the questions," and then received
me with affection. From Jenne to Timbuctoo we journeyed by boat for
311 miles in a labyrinth of meandering tributaries, creeks, and
channels along the course of the Niger, and reached at last the
Pool of Dai, whose waters appear under the walls of Timbuctoo
itself; and then, a few miles further on, we arrived at Kabara, the
landing-place and port of Timbuctoo.</p>

<p>Two things arrest attention on disembarking&mdash;the sand and
the Touaregs. The sand, because you have no sooner set your foot on
shore than you flounder about in it as if it were a mire; and it
pursues you everywhere&mdash;in the country, in the streets, and in
the houses. The Touaregs are impressed on you because, though you
never see them, everything recalls them. The town is in ruins, but
its wretchedness is overpowered by life and movement. The quays are
astir with lively bustle, and encumbered with bales, jars, and
sacks in the process of unloading. To travel from Kabara to
Timbuctoo, only five miles distant, there is a daily
convoy&mdash;medley of people, donkeys and camels, attended by
twenty <i>tirailleurs</i> with rifles on their shoulders.</p>

<p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">
143</a></span>An immense and vivid sky, and an immense and brilliant stretch
of land, with the grand outlines of a town uniting the two. A dark
silhouette, large and long, an image of grandness in
immensity&mdash;thus appeared the Queen of the Sudan. She is indeed
the city of imagination, the Timbuctoo of legends. Her sandy
approaches are strewn with bones and carcasses that have been
disinterred by wild beasts, the remains of the camels and other
animals that have fallen and died in the last stages of the
journey.</p>

<p>The illusion of walls, produced by the distinctness with which
the town stands out from the white sand, disappears, and three
towers at regular intervals dominate the mass. The terraces of
square houses are now distinguishable, renewing the first
impression of grandeur in immensity. We enter the town, and behold!
all the grandeur has suddenly disappeared, though the scene is
equally impressive on account of its tragic character rather than
its beauty. And this is the great Timbuctoo, the metropolis of the
Sudan and the Sahara, with its boasted wealth and commerce! This is
Timbuctoo the holy, the learned, that life of the Niger, of which
it was written, "We shall one day correct the texts of our Greek
and Latin classics by the manuscripts which are preserved there."
These ruins, this rubbish, this wreck of a town, is this the secret
of Timbuctoo the Mysterious? It is a city of deliquescence.</p>

<p>Jenne had the vein of Egyptian civilisation; the origin of
Timbuctoo has to be sought in a different direction, for her past
is connected with the Arabian civilisation of Northern
Africa&mdash;the world of the Berbers and all those white people
whom we have known under the name of Touaregs in the Sahara,
Kabyles in Algeria, Moors in Morocco and Senegal, and Foulbes in
their infiltrations into the Sudan, who had been crowded back into
the interior by the invasions of Ph&oelig;nician and Roman colonists.
So also, when the Moors were driven<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span> out of Spain back to
Morocco, to find their ancient patrimony in the hands of Arabs,
they were forced to prolong their exodus into the south, and became
nomads about the great lakes on the left bank of the Niger, in the
neighbourhood of Oualata and Timbuctoo, carrying with them the name
of Andalusians, which they bear to the present day.</p>

<p>Touareg is a generic name for a large number of tribes descended
from the Berbers. Being driven into the desert, to the terrible
glare of which they were not accustomed, nor their lungs to its
sandstorms, they adopted the head-dress of two veils. Being
perpetually kept on the march, every social and political
organisation disappeared, and they gradually lost all notion of law
and order. Like the Jews, and all other people thrown out of their
natural paths, their souls and brains became steeped in vice. Their
nomadic life reduced them to the level of vagabonds, thieves, and
brigands, and the only law they recognised was the right of the
strongest. Travellers and merchants were their principal victims,
and when these failed, they robbed and killed each other.</p>

<p>They adopted a vague form of Islamism which they reduced to a
belief in talismans, and the Sudanese bestowed upon them three
epithets which epitomise their psychology&mdash;"Thieves, Hyenas,
and the Abandoned of God." Yet it was to these people that
Timbuctoo owed its origin, for it was there that they established a
permanent camp. It was under the dominion of Askia the Great, who
drove the Touaregs out of the city, that Timbuctoo became the great
and learned city whose fame spread even to Europe, and its apogee
was reached in 1494-1591.</p>

<p>The decadence of the city began with the Moorish conquest in the
latter year, and it became the scene of repeated incursions by
various tribes&mdash;Touaregs, Foulbes, Roumas. Under the hands of
a thousand tyrants<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id=
"Page_145">145</a></span> the inhabitants were robbed,
ill-treated, and killed on the least provocation. To avoid being
pillaged in the open street, and seeing their houses despoiled,
they adopted a new manner of living. They transformed their
garments and dwellings, and ceasing to be Timbuctoo the Great, they
became Timbuctoo the Mysterious. By these means the town acquired a
tumble-down and battered appearance. Timbuctoo is the meeting
place, says an old Sudanese chronicle, of all who travel by camel
or canoe. The camel represents the commerce of Sahara and the whole
of Northern Africa, while the canoe represents the trade of the
Sudan and Nigeria.</p>

<p>A great part of the trade is in rock-salt, derived from the
mines of Taoudenni, near Timbuctoo. Large caravans from Morocco,
Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli, numbering from 600 to 1,000 camels,
and from three to five hundred men, arrive from December to
January, and from July to August. Their freight represents from six
hundred thousand to a million francs' worth of goods. Smaller
caravans of sixty or a hundred camels arrive all the year round,
and between fifty and sixty thousand camels encamp annually in the
caravan suburb before the northern walls of the city. The city is
simply a temporary depot, and the permanent population are merely
brokers and contractors, or landlords of houses which are let to
travelling merchants. The chief manufacturing industry of the city
is exquisite embroidered robes, which cost from three to four
thousand francs each, and are principally exported to Morocco.</p>

<p>An ancient Sudanese proverb says, "Salt comes from the north,
gold from the south, and silver from the country of the white men,
but the word of God and the treasures of wisdom are only to be
found in Timbuctoo." It would be an exaggeration to put the
university in the mosque of Sankor&eacute; on a level with those of
Egypt, Morocco, or Syria, but it was the great intellectual nucleus
of the Sudan, and also one of the great scientific<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
centres of Islam itself. Her collection of ancient manuscripts
leaves us in no doubt upon the point. There is an entire class of
the population devoted to the study of letters. They are called
Marabuts, or Sheikhs, and from them doctors, priests,
schoolmasters, and jurists are drawn.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;The Romance of the Modern
Conquest</i></div>

<p>The prosperity of the French Sudan is so closely connected with
that of its principal market that if the general anarchy had been
prolonged in Timbuctoo all the sacrifices of human life and money
France had made on her threshold would have remained sterile. The
French Government decided that the sooner an end was put to the
ruinous dominion of the Touaregs the better it would be. Up to the
last moment England endeavoured to put her hand upon the commerce
of Timbuctoo. Failing in her efforts from Tripoli and the Niger's
mouth, she attempted to secure a footing by way of Morocco, and was
installed towards 1890 at Cape Juby. It was then too late. French
columns and posts had been slowly advanced by the Senegal route,
and in 1893 Jenne was captured.</p>

<p>In the following year a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched
while two columns of troops followed up to anticipate any
concentration of nomad Touaregs, which might prevent the occupation
of the Mysterious City. From the flotilla a detachment of nineteen
men was landed. Of these only seven were Europeans, the remainder
being Senegalese negroes. They had two machine guns with them, and,
under the command of a naval lieutenant, Boiteux by name, they
marched to the walls of Timbuctoo, and demanded that the rulers of
the city should surrender it, and that they should sign a treaty of
peace placing the country under the protectorate of France. The
city was occupied, temporary<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> fortlets were run up,
and the nineteen mariners held them till January 10, 1894, when the
first of the two of the French columns entered the town.
Twenty-five days later the second column arrived.</p>

<p>The French occupation of Timbuctoo the Mysterious was complete,
and Cape Juby was evacuated by England. Two large forts have now
replaced the improvised fortifications, and their guns command
every side of the town. Under their protection the inhabitants are
reviving. The long nightmare of the Touaregs is being slowly
dispelled. Houses are being repaired and rebuilt; the occupants
leave their doors ajar, and resume their beautifully embroidered
robes; and one can picture the city becoming a centre of European
civilisation and science as it was formerly of Mussulman
culture.</p>

<h4>RICHARD HAKLUYT</h4>

<h4>The Principall Navigations</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Of the Book and Why it was
Made</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Richard Hakluyt, born about 1552 in Herefordshire, England, was
educated at Westminster and Christ Church, Oxford, and became in
1590 rector of Wetheringsett, in Suffolk, where he compiled and
arranged "The Principall Navigations, Voyages, Traffikes, and
Discoveries of the English Nation to the Remote Quarters of the
Earth at any Time within the Compass of these 1600 Years." He grew
to manhood in the midst of the most stirring period of travel and
discovery that England has known. Under Elizabeth, English sailors
and English travellers were penetrating beyond the dim borders of
the known world, and almost every returning ship brought back fresh
news of strange lands. "Richard Hakluyt, Preacher," tells how his
interest was attracted towards this subject of travel and
exploration which he made his own. He published other records of
travel, but it is through the "Principall Navigations" that his
name has been perpetuated. Hakluyt died on November 23, 1616.</p>
</div>

<p>I do remember that being a youth, and one of her Majestie's
scholars at Westminster, that fruitfull nurserie, it was my happe
to visit the chamber of Master Richard Hakluyt, my cousin, a
gentleman of the Middle Temple, at a time when I found lying open
upon his borde certeine bookes of cosmographie, with an universall
mappe; he seeing me somewhat curious in the view thereof, began to
instruct my ignorance, by showing me the division of the earth into
three parts, after the old account, and then, according to the
latter and better distribution, into more. He pointed out with his
wand to all the known seas, gulfs, bayes, streights, capes, rivers,
empires, kingdoms, dukedoms, and territories of each part, with
declaration also of their speciall commodities, and particular
wants, which by the benefit of traffike, and intercourse of
merchants, are plentifully supplied.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">
149</a></span> From the mappe he brought me to the Bible, and
turning to the 107th Psalme, directed me to the 23rd and 24th
verses, where I read that "they which go downe to the sea in ships,
and occupy by the great waters, they see the works of the Lord, and
his wonders in the deepe," etc.</p>

<p>Which words of the prophet together with my cousin's discourse
(things of high and rare delight to my young nature), tooke in me
so deepe an impression that I constantly resolved, if ever I were
preferred to the university, where better time, and more convenient
place might be ministered for these studies, I would, by God's
assistance, prosecute that knowledge and kinde of literature, the
doores whereof were so happily opened before me.</p>

<p>According to which my resolution when, not long after, I was
removed to Christ Church in Oxford, my exercises of duty first
performed, I fell to my intended course, and by degrees read over
whatsoever printed or written discoveries and voyages I found
extant, either in the Greeke, Latine, Italian, Spanish, Portugall,
French, or English languages. In continuance of time I grew
familiarly acquainted with the chiefest captaines at sea, the
gretest merchants, and the best mariners of our nation, by which
means having gotten somewhat more than common knowledge.</p>

<p>I passed at length the narrow seas into France. There I both
heard in speech and read in books other nations miraculously
extolled for their discoveries and notable enterprises by sea, but
the English, of all others, for their sluggish security and
continuall neglect of the like attempts, either ignominiously
reported or exceedingly condemned. Thus, both hearing and reading
the obluquie of our nation, and finding few or none of our owne men
able to replie heerin, and further, not seeing any man to have care
to recommend to the world the industrious labors and painefull
travels of our countrymen, myselfe returned from France, determined
to undertake the burden of that worke, wherein all others<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">
150</a></span> pretended either ignorance or lacke of leasure,
whereas the huge toile, and the small profit to insue, were the
chiefe causes of the refusall.</p>

<p>I calle the worke a burden, in consideration that these voyages
lay so dispersed and hidden in severall hucksters' hands that I now
wonder at myselfe to see how I was able to endure the delays,
curiosity, and backwardnesse of many from whom I was to receive my
originals. And thus, friendly reader, thou seest the briefe summe
and scope of my labours for the commonwealth's sake, and thy sake,
bestowed upon this work, which may, I pray, bring thee no little
profit.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Victories of King Arthur in
Foreign Lands</i></div>

<p>Arthur, which was sometimes the most renowned king of the
Britaines, was a mightie and valiant man, and a famous warriour.
This kingdome was too little for him, and his minde was not
contented with it. He therefore valiantly subdued all Scantia,
which is now called Norway, and islands beyond Norway, to wit,
Island and Greenland, Sweueland, Ireland, Gotland, Denmarke, and
all the other lands and islands of the East Sea, even into Russia,
and many others islands beyond Norway, even under the North Pole,
which are appendances of Scantia, now called Norway. These people
were wild and savage, and held not in them the love of God nor of
their neighbours, because all evill cometh from the North; yet
there were among them certeine Christians living in secret. But
King Arthur was an exceeding good Christian, and caused them to be
baptised and thorowout all Norway to worship one God, and to
receive and keepe inviolably for ever faith in Christ onely.</p>

<p>At that time, all the noble men of Norway tooke wives of the
noble nation of the Britaines, whereupon the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Norses say that they are descended of the race and blood of this
kingdome. The aforesaid King Arthur obteined also, in those days of
the Pope and court of Rome, that Norway should be for ever annexed
to the crown of Britaine for the inlargement of this kingdome, and
he called it the chamber of Britaine. For this cause the Norses say
that they ought to dwell with us in this kingdome&mdash;to wit,
that they belong to the crowne of Britaine; for they had rather
dwell here than in their owne native countrey, which is drie and
full of mountaines, and barren, and no graine growing there, but in
certain places. But this countrey of Britaine is fruitfull, wherein
corne and all other good things do grow and increase, for which
cause many cruell battles have been often-times fought betwixt the
Englishmen and the people of Norway, and infinite numbers of people
have been slaine, and the Norses have possessed many lands and
islands of this Empire, which unto this day they doe possess,
neither could they ever afterwards be fully expelled.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;How Martin Frobisher Sought a
Passage to Cathaya by the North-West</i></div>

<p>It appeareth that not onely the middle zone but also the zones
about the Poles are habitable. Which thing, being well considered,
and familiarly knowen to our generall, Captaine Frobisher, as well
for that he is thorowly furnished of the knowledge of the sphere
and all other skilles appertaining to the arte of navigation, as
also for the confirmation he hath of the same by many yeares
experience, both by sea and land, and being persuaded of a new and
nerer passage to Cathaya than by Capo di Buona Speran&ccedil;a; he
began first with himself to devise, and then with his friends to
conferre, and declared unto them that that voyage was not onely
possible by the North-west, but he could prove easie to be
performed.</p>

<p>And, further, he determined and resolved with himselfe<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
to go make full proofe thereof, and to accomplish or bring true
certificate of the truth, or else never to return againe, knowing
this to be the onely thing of the world that was left yet undone,
whereby a notable minde might be made famous and fortunate. But,
although his will were great to performe this notable voyage, yet
he wanted altogether meanes and ability to set forward, and
performe the same. He layed open to many great estates and learned
men the plot and summe of his device. And so, by litle and litle,
with no small expense and paine, he brought his cause to some
perfection, and had drawen together so many adventurers and such
summes of money as might well defray a reasonable charge to furnish
himselfe to sea withall.</p>

<p>He prepared two small barks of twenty and five and twenty tunne
apiece, wherein he intended to accomplish his pretended voyage.
Wherefore, being furnished with the aforesayd two barks, and one
small pinnesse of ten tun burthen, having therein victuals and
other necessaries for twelve months provision, he departed upon the
sayd voyage from Blacke-wall the fifteenth of June, <i>Anno
Domini</i>, 1576. One of the barks wherein he went was named the
Gabriel, and the other the Michael, and, sailing northwest from
England upon the eleventh of July he had sight of an high and
ragged land which he judged to be Frisland, but durst not approch
the same, by reason of the great store of ice that lay alongst the
coast, and the great mists that troubled them not a litle. Not
farre from thence he lost company of his small pinnesse, which by
meanes of a great storme he supposed to be swallowed up of the sea,
wherein he lost onely foure men. Also the other barke, named the
Michael, mistrusting the matter, conveyed themselves privily away
from him, and returned home, with great report that he was cast
away.</p>

<p>The worthy captaine, notwithstanding these discomforts, although
his mast was sprung, and his toppe mast<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span> blowen overboord
with extreame foul weather, continued his course towards the
north-west, knowing that the sea at length must needs have an
ending, and that some land should have a beginning that way; and
determined, therefore, at the least to bring true proofe what land
and sea the same might be so farre to the north-westwards, beyond
any man that had heretofore discovered. And the twentieth of July
he had sight of an high land which he called Queen Elizabeth's
Forland, after her majestie's name, and sailing more northerly
alongst that coast, he descried another forland with a great gut,
baye, or passage, divided as it were two maine lands or continents
asunder.</p>

<p>He determined to make proofe of this place, to see how farre
that gut had continuance, and whether he might carry himself thorow
the same into some open sea on the backe side, whereof he conceived
no small hope, and so entered the same the one and twentieth of
July, and passed above fifty leagues therein as he reported, having
upon either hand a great maine, or continent. And that land upon
his right hand as he sailed westward he judged to be the continent
of Asia, and there to be divided from the firme of America, which
lieth upon the left hand over against the same. This place he named
after his name, Frobisher's Streights.</p>

<p>After our captaine, Martin Frobisher, had passed sixty leagues
into this foresayed streight, he went ashore, and found signes
where fire had bene made.</p>

<p>He saw mighty deere that seemed to be mankinde, which ranne at
him, and hardly he escaped with his life in a narrow way where he
was faine to use defence and policy to save his life. In this place
he saw and perceived sundry tokens of the peoples resorting
thither. And, being ashore upon the top of a hill, he perceived a
number of small things fleeting in the sea afarre off, which he
supposed to be porposes or seales, or some kinde of strange fish;
but, coming neerer, he discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span> them to be men in
small boats made of leather. And, before he could descend downe
from the hill, certeine of those people had almost cut off his boat
from him, having stolen secretly behinde the rocks for that
purpose, when he speedily hasted to his boat, and bent himselfe to
his halberd, and narrowly escaped the danger, and saved his
boat.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he had sundry conferences with them, and they came
aboord his ship, and brought him salmon and raw flesh and fish, and
greedily devoured the same before our men's faces.</p>

<p>After great courtesie, and many meetings, our mariners, contrary
to their captaine's direction, began more easily to trust them, and
five of our men, going ashore, were by them intercepted with their
boat, and were never since heard of to this day againe, so that the
captaine, being destitute of boat, barke, and all company, had
scarsely sufficient number to conduct back his barke againe. He
could not now convey himselfe ashore to rescue his men&mdash;if he
had been able&mdash;for want of a boat; and againe the subtile
traitours were so wary, as they would after that never come within
our men's danger.</p>

<p>The captaine notwithstanding, desirous to bring some token from
thence of his being there, was greatly discontented that he had not
before apprehended some of them; and, therefore, to deceive the
deceivers he wrought a prety policy, for, knowing wel how they
greatly delited in our toyes, and specially in belles, he rang a
pretty lowbel, making signes that he would give him the same that
would come and fetch it. And to make them more greedy of the matter
he rang a louder bel, so that in the end one of them came nere the
ship side to receive the bel; which when he thought to take at the
captaine's hand he was thereby taken himselfe; for the captaine,
being readily provided, let the bel fall and caught the man fast,
and plucked him with main force, boat and all, into his barke out
of the sea. Whereupon, when he<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span> found himself in
captivity, for very choler and disdaine he bit his tongue in twain
within his mouth; notwithstanding, he died not thereof, but lived
until he came in England, and then he died of cold.</p>

<p>Nor with this new pray (which was a sufficient witnesse of the
captaine's farre and tedious travell towards the unknowen parts of
the world, as did well appeare by this strange infidell, whose like
was never seene, read, nor heard of before, and whose language was
neither knowen nor understood of any), the sayd Captaine Frobisher
returned homeward, and arrived in England in Harwich, the second of
October following, and thence came to London, 1576, where he was
highly commended by all men for his notable attempt, but specially
for the great hope he brought of the passage to Cathaya.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Valiant Fight of the Content
against some Spanish Ships</i></div>

<p>Three ships of Sir George Carey made a notable fight against
certaine Spanish galleys in the West Indies, and this is the
relation of it.</p>

<p>The 13th of June, 1591, being Sunday, at five of the clock in
the morning we descried six saile of the King of Spain, his ships.
We met with them off the Cape de Corrientes, which standeth on the
Island of Cuba. The sight of the foresayd ships made us joyfull,
hoping that they should make our voyage. But as soon as they
descryed us they made false fires one to another, and gathered
their fleet together. We, therefore, at six of the clock in the
morning, having made our prayers to Almighty God, prepared
ourselves for the fight. We in the Content bare up with their
vice-admiral, and (ranging along by his broadside aweather of him)
gave him a volley of muskets and our great ordinance; then, coming
up with another small ship ahead of the former, we hailed her in
such sort that she payd roome.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>Thus being in fight with the little ship, we saw a great smoke
come from our admiral, and the Hopewel and Swallow, forsaking him
with all the sailes they could make; whereupon, bearing up with our
admiral (before we could come to him) we had both the small ships
to windward of us, purposing (if we had not bene too hotte for
them) to have layd us aboord.</p>

<p>Thus we were forced to stand to the northwards, the Hopewel and
the Swallow not coming in all this while to ayde us, as they might
easily have done. Two of their great ships and one of their small
followed us. They having a loom gale (we being altogether becalmed)
with both their great ships came up faire by us, shot at us, and on
the sudden furled their sprit sailes and mainsailes, thinking that
we could not escape them. Then falling to prayer, we shipped our
oars that we might rowe to shore, and anker in shallow water, where
their great ships could not come nie us, for other refuge we had
none.</p>

<p>Then one of their small ships being manned from one of their
great, and having a boat to rowe themselves in, shipped her oars
likewise, and rowed after us, thinking with their small shot to
have put us from our oars until the great ships might come up with
us; but by the time she was within musket shot, the Lord of His
mercie did send us a faire gale of wind at the north-west, off the
shore, what time we stood to the east.</p>

<p>Afterward (commending our selves to Almightie God in prayer, and
giving him thankes for the winde which he had sent us for our
deliverance) we looked forth, and descryed two saile more to the
offen; these we thought to have bene the Hopewel and the Swallow
that had stoode in to ayde us; but it proved farre otherwise, for
they were two of the king's gallies.</p>

<p>Then one of them came up, and (hayling of us whence our shippe
was) a Portugall which we had with us, made them answere, that we
were of the fleete of Terra Firma,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span> and of Sivil; with
that they bid us amaine English dogs, and came upon our quarter
star-boord, and giving us five cast pieces out of her prowe they
sought to lay us aboord; but we so galled them with our muskets
that we put them from our quarter. Then they winding their gallie,
came up into our sterne, and with the way that the gallie had, did
so violently thrust into the boorde of our captaine's cabbin, that
her nose came into its minding to give us all their prowe and so to
sinke us. But we, being resolute, so plyed them with our small shot
that they could have no time to discharge their great ordnance; and
when they began to approch we heeved into them a ball of fire, and
by that meanes put them off; whereupon they once again fell asterne
of us, and gave us a prowe.</p>

<p>Then, having the second time put them off, we went to prayer,
and sang the first part of the 25th Psalme, praysing God for our
safe deliverance. This being done, we might see two gallies and a
frigat, all three of them bending themselves together to encounter
us; whereupon we (eftsoones commending our estate into the hands of
God) armed ourselves, and resolved (for the honour of God, her
majestie, and our countrey) to fight it out till the last man.</p>

<p>Then, shaking a pike of fire in defiance of the enemie, and
weaving them amaine, we bad them come aboord; and an Englishman in
the gallie made answer that they would come aboord presently. Our
fight continued with the ships and with the gallies from seven of
the clocke in the morning till eleven at night.</p>

<p>Howbeit God (which never faileth them that put their trust in
Him) sent us a gale of winde about two of the clocke in the
morning, at east-north-east, which was for the preventing of their
crueltie and the saving of our lives. The next day being the
fourteenth of June in the morning, we sawe all our adversaries to
lee-ward of us; and they, espying us, chased us till<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> ten
of the clocke; and then, seeing they could not prevaile, gave us

<h4>A. W. KINGLAKE</h4>

<h4>Eothen</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Through Servia to
Constantinople</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Alexander William Kinglake, born near Taunton, England, Aug. 5,
1809, was the eldest son of William Kinglake, banker and solicitor,
of Taunton. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, where he was a
friend of Tennyson and Thackeray. In 1835 he made the Eastern tour
described in "Eothen [Greek, 'from the dawn'], or Traces of Travel
Brought Home from the East," which was twice re-written before it
appeared in 1844. It is more a record of personal impressions of
the countries visited than an ordinary book of travel, and is
distinguished for its refined style and delightful humour. Kinglake
accompanied St. Arnaud and his army in the campaign which resulted
in the conquest of Algiers for France. In 1854 he went to the
Crimea with the British troops, met Lord Raglan, and stayed with
the British commander until the opening of the siege of Sebastopol.
At the request of Lady Raglan he wrote the famous history of the
"Invasion of the Crimea," which appeared at intervals between 1863
and 1887. He died on January 2, 1891.</p>
</div>

<p>At Semlin I was still encompassed by the scenes and sounds of
familiar life, yet whenever I chose to look southward I saw the
Ottoman fortress&mdash;austere, and darkly impending high over the
vale of the Danube&mdash;historic Belgrade. I had come to the end
of wheel-going Europe, and now my eyes would see the splendour and
havoc of the East. We managed the work of departure from Semlin
with nearly as much solemnity as if we had been departing this
life. The plague was supposed to be raging in the Ottoman Empire,
and we were asked by our Semlin friends if we were perfectly
certain that we had wound up all our affairs in Christendom.</p>

<p>We soon reached the southern bank in our row-boat, and were met
by an invitation from the pasha to pay<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> him a visit. In
the course of an interesting interview, conducted with Oriental
imagery by our dragoman, we informed the pasha that we were obliged
for his hospitality and the horses he had promised for our journey
to Constantinople, whereupon the pasha, standing up on his divan,
said, "Proud are the sires and blessed are the dams of the horses
that shall carry your excellency to the end of your prosperous
journey."</p>

<p>Our party, consisting of my companion, Methley, our personal
servants, interpreter, and escort, started from Belgrade, as usual,
hours after the arranged time, and night had closed in as we
entered the great Servian forest through which our road lay for
more than a hundred miles. When we came out of the forest our road
lay through scenes like those of an English park. There are few
countries less infested by "lions in the path," in the shape of
historic monuments, and therefore there were no perils. The only
robbers we saw anything of had been long since dead and gone.</p>

<p>The poor fellows had been impaled upon high poles, and so
propped up by the transverse spokes beneath them that their
skeletons, clothed with some white, wax-like remains of flesh,
still sat up lolling in the sunshine, and listlessly stared without
eyes. After a fifteen days' journey we crossed the Golden Horn, and
found shelter in Stamboul.</p>

<p>All the while I stayed at Constantinople the plague was
prevailing. Its presence lent a mysterious and exciting, though not
very pleasant, interest to my first knowledge of a great Oriental
city. Europeans, during the prevalence of the plague, if they are
forced to enter into the streets, will carefully avoid the touch of
every human being they pass. The Moslem stalks on serenely, as
though he were under the eye of his God, and were "equal to either
fate."</p>

<p>In a steep street or a narrow alley you meet one of those
coffin-shaped bundles of white linen which implies<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span> an
Ottoman lady. She suddenly withdraws the yashmak, shines upon your
heart and soul with all the pomp and might of her beauty. This
dazzles your brain; she sees and exults; then with a sudden
movement she lays her blushing fingers upon your arm and cries out,
"Yumourdjak!" (plague), meaning, "There is a present of the plague
for you." This is her notion of a witticism.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Troad, Smyrna, and
Cyprus</i></div>

<p>While my companion, Methley, was recovering from illness
contracted during our progress to Constantinople, I studied
Turkish, and sated my eyes with the pomps of the city and its
crowded waters. When capable of travelling, we determined to go to
Troad together. Away from our people and our horses, we went
loitering along the plains of Troy by the willowy banks of a stream
which I could see was finding itself new channels from year to
year, and flowed no longer in its ancient track. But I knew that
the springs which fed it were high in Ida&mdash;the springs of
Simois and Scamander. Methley reminded me that Homer himself had
warned us of some such changes. The Greeks, in beginning their
wall, had neglected the hecatombs due to the gods, and so, after
the fall of Troy, Apollo turned the paths of the rivers that flow
from Ida, and sent them flooding over the wall till all the beach
was smooth and free from the unhallowed works of the Greeks.</p>

<p>After a journey of some days, we reached Smyrna, from which
place private affairs obliged Methley to return to England. Smyrna
may be called the chief town of the Greek race, against which you
will be cautioned so carefully as soon as you touch the Levant. For
myself, I love the race, in spite of their vices and their
meannesses. I remember the blood that is in them. I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
sailed from Smyrna in the Amphitrite&mdash;a Greek brigantine which
was confidently said to be bound for the coast of Smyrna. I knew
enough of Greek navigation to be sure that our vessel should touch
at many an isle before I set foot upon the Syrian coast. My
patience was extremely useful to me, for the cruise altogether
endured some forty days. We touched at Cyprus, whither the ship ran
for shelter in half a gale of wind. A Greek of Limasol who hoisted
his flag as English Vice-Consul insisted upon my accepting his
hospitality. The family party went off very well. The mamma was shy
at first, but she veiled the awkwardness she felt by affecting to
scold her children, who had all of them immortal names. Every
instant I was delighted by some such phrases as these:
"Themistocles, my love, don't fight," "Alcibiades, can't you sit
still?" "Socrates, put down the cup!" "Oh, fie! Aspasia, don't be
naughty!"</p>

<p>The heathenish longing to visit the scene where for Pallas
Athene "the hundred altars glowed with Arabian incense, and
breathed with the fragrance of garlands ever fresh," found
disenchantment when I spent the night in the cabin of a Greek
priest&mdash;not a priest of the goddess, but of the Greek
church&mdash;where there was but one room for man, priest, and
beast. A few days after, our brigantine sailed for Beyrout.</p>

<p>At Beyrout I soon discovered that the standing topic of interest
was the Lady Hester Stanhope, who lived in an old convent on the
Lebanon range at a distance of a day's journey from the town, and
was acknowledged as an inspired being by the people of the
mountains, and as more than a prophet.</p>

<p>I visited Lady Hester in her dwelling-place, a broad, grey mass
of irregular buildings on the summit of one of the many low hills
of Lebanon. I was received by her ladyship's doctor, and apartments
were set apart for myself and my party. After dinner the doctor
conducted me to Miladi's chamber, where the lady prophetess
received<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">
163</a></span> me standing up to the full of her majestic
height, perfectly still and motionless until I had taken my
appointed place, when she resumed her seat on a common European
sofa.</p>

<p>Her ladyship addressed to me some inquiries respecting my
family; and then the spirit of the prophetess kindled within her,
and for hours and hours this wondrous white woman poured forth her
speech, for the most part concerning sacred and profane mysteries.
Now and again she adverted to the period when she exercised
astonishing sway and authority over the wandering Bedouin tribes in
the desert which lies between Damascus and Palmyra.</p>

<p>Lady Hester talked to me long and earnestly on the subject of
religion, announcing that the Messiah was yet to come. She strived
to impress me with the vanity and falseness of all European creeds,
as well as with a sense of her own spiritual greatness. Throughout
her conversation upon these high topics, she skilfully insinuated,
without actually asserting, her heavenly rank.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Nazareth, Jordan, and the Dead
Sea</i></div>

<p>I crossed the plain of Esdraelon, and entered amongst the hills
of beautiful Galilee. It was at sunset that my path brought me
sharply round into the gorge of a little valley, and close upon a
grey mass of dwellings that lay happily nestled in the lap of the
mountain. It was Christian Nazareth.</p>

<p>Within the precincts of the Latin convent, in which I was
quartered, there stands a great Catholic church, which encloses the
sanctuary&mdash;the dwelling of the Blessed Virgin. This is a
grotto, forming a little chapel, to which you descend by steps.</p>

<p>The attending friar led me down, all but silently, to the
Virgin's home. Religion and gracious custom commanded me that I
fall down loyally and kiss the rock<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span> that blessed Mary
pressed. With a half-consciousness, a semblance of a thrilling hope
that I was plunging deep into my first knowledge of some most holy
mystery, or of some new, rapturous, and daring sin, I knelt and
bowed down my face till I met the smooth rock with my lips.</p>

<p>One moment&mdash;my heart, or some old pagan demon within me,
woke up, and fiercely bounded&mdash;my bosom was lifted and swam as
though I had touched her warm robe. One moment&mdash;one more, and
then&mdash;the fever had left me. I rose from my knees. I felt
hopelessly sane. The mere world reappeared. My good old monk was
there, dangling his keys with listless patience; and as he guided
me from the church, and talked of the refectory and the coming
repast, I listened to his words with some attention and
pleasure.</p>

<p>Having engaged a young Nazarene as guide to Jerusalem, our party
passed by Cana, and the house in which the water had been turned
into wine, and came to the field in which our Saviour had rebuked
the Scotch Sabbath-keepers of that period by suffering His
disciples to pluck corn on the Sabbath day.</p>

<p>I rode over the ground on which the fainting multitude had been
fed, and was shown some massive fragments&mdash;relics, I was told,
of that wondrous banquet, now turned into stone. The petrifaction
was most complete. I ascended the heights on which our Lord was
standing when He wrought the miracle, and looked away eagerly
eastward. There lay the Sea of Galilee, less stern than Wastwater,
less fair than gentle Windermere, but still with the winning ways
of an English lake. My mind, however, flew away from the historical
associations of the place, and I thought of the mysterious desert
which stretched from these grey hills to the gates of Bagdad.</p>

<p>I went on to Tiberias, and soon got afloat upon the water. In
the evening I took up my quarters in the Catholic church. Tiberias
is one of the four holy cities,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span> the others being
Jerusalem, Hebron, and Safet; and, according to the Talmud, it is
from Tiberias, or its immediate neighbourhood, that the Messiah is
to arise. Except at Jerusalem, never think of attempting to sleep
in a "holy city."</p>

<p>After leaving Tiberias, we rode for some hours along the right
bank of the Jordan till we came to an old Roman bridge which
crossed the river. My Nazarene guide, riding ahead of the party,
led on over the bridge. I knew that the true road to Jerusalem must
be mainly by the right bank, but I supposed that my guide had
crossed the bridge in order to avoid some bend in the river, and
that he knew of a ford lower down by which we should regain the
western bank. For two days we wandered, unable to find a ford
across the swollen river, and at last the guide fell on his knees
and confessed that he knew nothing of the country. Thrown upon my
own resources, I concluded that the Dead Sea must be near, and in
the afternoon I first caught sight of those waters of death which
stretched deeply into the southern desert. Before me and all around
as far as the eye could follow, blank hills piled high over hills,
pale, yellow, and naked, walled up in her tomb for ever the dead
and damned of Gomorrah.</p>

<p>The water is perfectly bright and clear, its taste detestable.
My steps were reluctantly turned towards the north. On the west
there flowed the impassable Jordan, on the east stood an endless
range of barren mountains, on the south lay the desert sea.
Suddenly there broke upon my ear the ludicrous bray of a living
donkey. I followed the direction of the sound, and in a hollow came
upon an Arab encampment. Through my Arab interpreter an arrangement
was come to with the sheikh to carry my party and baggage in safety
to the other bank of the river on condition that I should give him
and his tribe a "teskeri," or written certificate of their good
conduct, and some baksheish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>The passage was accomplished by means of a raft formed of
inflated skins and small boughs cut from the banks of the river,
and guided by Arabs swimming alongside. The horses and mules were
thrown into the water and forced to swim over. We camped on the
right side of the river for the night, and the Arabs were made most
savagely happy by the tobacco with which I supplied them, and they
spent the whole night in one smoking festival. I parted upon very
good terms from this tribe, and in three hours gained Rihah, a
village said to occupy the ancient site of Jericho. Some hours
after sunset I reached the convent of Santa Saba.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Jerusalem and Bethlehem</i></div>

<p>The enthusiasm that had glowed, or seemed to glow, within me for
one blessed moment when I knelt by the shrine of the Blessed Virgin
at Nazareth was not rekindled at Jerusalem. In the stead of the
solemn gloom, and a deep stillness which by right belonged to the
Holy City, there was the hum and the bustle of active life. It was
the "height of the season." The Easter ceremonies drew near, and
pilgrims were flocking in from all quarters. The space fronting the
church of the Holy Sepulchre becomes a kind of bazaar. I have never
seen elsewhere in Asia so much commercial animation. When I entered
the church I found a babel of worshippers. Greek, Roman, and
Armenian priests were performing their different rites in various
nooks, and crowds of disciples were rushing about in all
directions&mdash;some laughing and talking, some begging, but most
of them going about in a regular, methodical way to kiss the
sanctified spots, speak the appointed syllables, and lay down their
accustomed coins. They seemed to be not "working out," but
"transacting" the great business of salvation.</p>

<p>The Holy Sepulchre is under the roof of this great<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
church. It is a handsome tomb of oblong form, partly subterranean.
You descend into the interior by a few steps, and there find an
altar with burning tapers. When you have seen enough of it you
feel, perhaps, weary of the busy crowd, and ask your dragoman
whether there will be time before sunset to procure horses and take
a ride to Mount Calvary.</p>

<p>"Mount Calvary, signor! It is upstairs&mdash;on the first
floor!" In effect you ascend just thirteen steps, and then are
shown the now golden sockets in which the crosses of our Lord and
the two thieves were fixed.</p>

<p>The village of Bethlehem lies prettily couched on the slope of a
hill. The sanctuary is a subterranean grotto, and is committed to
the joint guardianship of the Romans, Greeks, and Armenians, who
vie with each other in adorning it. Beneath an altar gorgeously
decorated, and lit with everlasting fires, there stands the low
slab of stone which marked the holy site of the Nativity, and near
to this is a hollow scooped out of the living rock. Here the infant
Jesus was laid. Near the spot of the Nativity is the rock against
which the Blessed Virgin was leaning when she presented her babe to
the adoring shepherds.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;To Cairo and the Pyramids</i></div>

<p>Gaza is upon the edge of the desert, to which it stands in the
same relation as a seaport to the sea. It is there that you charter
your camels, "the ships of the desert," and lay in your stores for
the voyage. The agreement with the desert Arabs includes a safe
conduct through their country as well as the hire of the camels. On
the ninth day, without startling incident, I arrived at the capital
of Egypt.</p>

<p>Cairo and the plague! During the whole time of my stay, the
plague was so master of the city, and showed himself so staringly
in every street and alley,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168"
id="Page_168">168</a></span> that I can't now affect to
dissociate the two ideas. I was the only European traveller in
Cairo, and was provided with a house by one Osman Effendi, whose
history was curious. He was a Scotchman born, and landed in Egypt
as a drummer-boy with Mackenzie Fraser's force, taken prisoner, and
offered the alternative of death or the Koran.</p>

<p>He did not choose death, and followed the orthodox standard of
the Prophet in fierce campaigns against the Wahabees. Returning to
Cairo in triumph from his Holy Wars, Osman began to flourish in the
world, acquired property, and became effendi, or gentleman, giving
pledge of his sincere alienation from Christianity by keeping a
couple of wives. The strangest feature in Osman's character was his
inextinguishable nationality. In his house he had three shelves of
books, and the books were thoroughbred Scotch! He afterwards died
of the plague, of which visitation one-half of the whole people of
the city, 200,000 in number, were carried off. I took it into my
pleasant head that the plague might be providential or epidemic,
but was not contagious, and therefore I determined that it should
not alter my habits in any one respect. I hired a donkey, and saw
all that was to be seen in the city in the way of public
buildings&mdash;one handsome mosque, which had been built by a
wealthy Hindoostanee merchant, and the citadel. From the platform
of the latter there is a superb view of the town. But your eyes are
drawn westward over the Nile, till they rest upon the massive
enormities of the Ghizeh pyramids. At length the great difficulty
which I had in procuring beasts for my departure was overcome, and
with two dromedaries and three camels I and my servants gladly
wound our way from out the pest-stricken city.</p>

<p>Of course, I went to see and explore the pyramids of Ghizeh,
Aboucir, and Sakkara, which I need not describe. Near the pyramids,
more wondrous and more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id=
"Page_169">169</a></span> awful than all else in the land of
Egypt, there sits the lonely sphinx. Upon ancient dynasties of
Ethiopian and Egyptian kings, upon conquerors, down through all the
ages till to-day, this unworldly sphinx has watched like a
Providence with the same earnest eyes, and the same sad, tranquil
mien. And we shall die, and Islam will wither away, and the
Englishman, leaning far over to hold his loved India, will plant a
firm foot on the banks of the Nile and sit in the seats of the
faithful, and still that sleepless rock will lie watching and
watching the works of the new, busy race with those same sad,
earnest eyes, the same tranquil mien everlasting.</p>

<p>I accomplished the journey to Suez after an exciting adventure
in the desert. There are two opinions as to the point at which the
Israelites passed the Red Sea. One is that they traversed only the
very small creek at the northern extremity of the inlet, and that
they entered the bed of the water at the spot on which Suez now
stands. The other is that they crossed the sea from a point
eighteen miles down the coast.</p>

<p>From Suez I crossed the desert once more to Gaza, and thence to
Nablous and Safet&mdash;beautiful on its craggy height. Thereafter,
for a part of two days, I wound under the base of the snow-crowned
Djibel El Sheik, and then entered upon a vast plain. Before evening
came there were straining eyes that saw, and joyful voices that
announced, the sight of the holy, blessed Damascus. This earthly
paradise of the Prophet is a city of hidden palaces, of copses and
gardens, fountains and bubbling streams.</p>

<p>The path by which I crossed the Lebanon is like that of the
Foorca in the Bernese Oberland, and from the white shoulder of the
mountain I saw the breadth of all Syria west of the range. I
descended, passing the group of cedars which is held sacred by the
Greek Church. They occupy three or four acres on the mountain-side,
and many of them are gnarled in a way that<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span> implies great
age; but I saw nothing in their appearance that tended to prove
them contemporaries of the cedars employed in Solomon's temple.
Beyrout was reached without further adventure, and my eastern
travel practically ended.</p>

<h4>AUSTEN HENRY LAYARD</h4>

<h4>Nineveh and Its Remains</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Mosul and its Hidden
Mysteries</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Sir Austen Henry Layard, the most famous of all Oriental
arch&aelig;ological explorers and discoverers, was born in Paris,
on March 5, 1817, and died on July 5, 1894. Intended for the
English legal profession, but contracting a dislike to the
prospect, he determined to make himself familiar with the romantic
regions of the Near East, and travelled in all parts of the Turkish
and Persian Empires, and through several districts of Arabia. The
desire came upon him to investigate the mysterious mounds on the
great plains of the Tigris and the Euphrates, and he began that
series of excavations which resulted in the most sensational
discoveries of modern times, for he unearthed the remains of the
long-buried city of Nineveh. With the marvellous, massive, and
sublime sculptures of winged, human-headed bulls and lions, and
eagle-headed deities, he enriched the galleries of the British
Museum, England thus becoming possessed of the finest collection of
the kind in the world. Layard's two volumes, "Nineveh and Its
Remains" (1848) and "Monuments of Nineveh" (1850), are unique
records of special enterprise and skill.</p>
</div>

<p>During the autumn of 1839 and winter of 1840, I had been
wandering through Asia Minor and Syria, scarcely leaving untrod one
spot hallowed by tradition, or unvisited one spot consecrated by
history. I was accompanied by one no less curious and enthusiastic
than myself&mdash;Edward Ledwich Mitford, afterwards engaged in the
civil service in Ceylon. We were both equally careless of comfort
and unmindful of danger. We rode alone; our arms were our only
protection; and we tended our own horses, except when relieved from
the duty by the hospitable inhabitants of a Turcoman village or an
Arab tent.</p>

<p>We left Aleppo on March 18, took the road through<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span> Bir
and Orfa, and, traversing the low country at the foot of the
Kurdish hills, reached Mosul on April 10.</p>

<p>During a short stay in the town we visited the great ruins on
the east bank of the river which have been generally believed to be
the remains of Nineveh. We rode into the desert and explored the
mound of Kalah Shergat, a vast, shapeless mass, covered with grass,
with remains of ancient walls laid open where the winter rains had
formed ravines.</p>

<p>A few fragments of ancient pottery and inscribed bricks proved
that it owed its construction to the people who had founded the
city of which the mounds of Nimroud are the remains. These huge
mounds of Assyria made a deeper impression upon me than the temples
of Baalbec and the theatres of Ionia. My curiosity had been greatly
excited, and I formed the design of thoroughly examining, whenever
it might be in my power, the ruins of Nimroud.</p>

<p>It was not till the summer of 1842 that I again passed through
Mosul on my way to Constantinople. I found that M. Botta had, since
my first visit, commenced excavations on the opposite side of the
Tigris in the large mound of Kouyunjik, and in the village of
Khorsabad. To him is due the honour of having found the first
Assyrian monument. He uncovered an edifice belonging to the age
preceding the conquests of Alexander. This was a marvellous and
epoch-making discovery.</p>

<p>My first step on reaching Mosul was to present my letters to
Mohammed Pasha, governor of the province. His appearance matched
his temper and conduct, and thus was not prepossessing. Nature had
placed hypocrisy beyond his reach. He had one eye and one ear, was
short and fat, deeply marked by small-pox, and uncouth in gestures
and harsh in voice. At the time of my arrival the population was in
despair at his exactions and cruelties.</p>

<p>The appearance of a stranger led to hopes, and reports<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">
173</a></span> were whispered about the town that I was the bearer
of the news of the disgrace of the tyrant. But his vengeance
speedily fell on the principal inhabitants, for such as had
hitherto escaped his rapacity were seized and stripped of their
property, on the plea that they had spread reports detrimental to
his authority.</p>

<p>Such was the pasha to whom I was introduced two days after my
arrival by the British Vice-Consul, M. Rassam. I understood that my
plans must be kept secret, though I was ready to put them into
operation. I knew that from the authorities and people of the town
I could only look for the most decided opposition. On November 8,
having secretly procured a few tools, I engaged a mason at the
moment of my departure, and carrying with me a variety of guns,
spears, and other formidable weapons, declared that I was going to
hunt wild boars in a neighbouring village, and floated down the
Tigris on a small raft, accompanied by Mr. Ross, a British merchant
then residing at Mosul, my cavass, and a servant.</p>

<p>At this time of year nearly seven hours are required to descend
the Tigris, from Mosul to Nimroud. It was sunset before we reached
the Awai, or dam across the river. We landed and walked to a small
hamlet called Naifa. We had entered a heap of ruins, but were
welcomed by an Arab family crouching round a heap of
half-extinguished embers. The half-naked children and women
retreated into a corner of the hut. The man, clad in ample cloak
and white turban, being able to speak a little Turkish, and being
active and intelligent, seemed likely to be of use to me.</p>

<p>I acquainted him with the object of my journey, offering him
regular employment in the event of the experiment proving
successful, and assigning him fixed wages as superintendent of the
workmen. He volunteered to walk, in the middle of the night, to
Selamiyah, a village three miles distant, and to some Arab tents in
the neighbourhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id=
"Page_174">174</a></span> to procure men to assist in
the excavations. I slept little during the night. Hopes long
cherished were now to be realised, or were to end in
disappointment.</p>

<p>Visions of palaces under ground, of gigantic monsters, or
sculptured figures, and endless inscriptions floated before me. In
the morning I was roused and informed that six workmen had been
secured. Twenty minutes' walk brought us to the principal mound.
Broken pottery and fragments of brick, inscribed with cuneiform
characters, were strewn on all sides. With joy I found the fragment
of a bas-relief. Convinced that sculptured remains must still exist
in some parts of the mound, I sought for a place where excavations
might be commenced with some prospects of success. Awad led me to a
piece of alabaster which appeared above the soil. We could not
remove it, and on digging downward it proved to be the upper part
of a large slab. I ordered the men to work around it, and shortly
we uncovered a second slab.</p>

<p>One after another, thirteen slabs came to light, the whole
forming a square, with a slab missing at one corner. We had found a
chamber, and the gap was at its entrance. I now dug down the face
of one of the stones, and a cuneiform inscription was soon exposed
to view. Leaving half the workmen to remove the rubbish from the
chamber, I led the rest to the south-west corner of the mound,
where I had observed many fragments of calcined alabaster.</p>

<p>A trench, opened in the side of the mound, brought me almost
immediately to a wall, bearing inscriptions in the same character.
Next day, five more workmen having joined, before evening the work
of the first party was completed, and I found myself in a room
panelled with slabs about eight feet high, and varying from six to
four feet in breadth.</p>

<p>Some objects of ivory, on which were traces of gold leaf had
been found by Awad in the ruins, and these I<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span> told
him to keep, much to his surprise. But word had already been sent
to the pasha of all details of my doings. When I called on him he
pretended at first to be ignorant of the excavations, but
presently, as if to convict me of prevarication in my answers to
his questions as to the amount of treasure discovered, pulled out
of his writing-tray a scrap of paper in which was an almost
invisible particle of gold leaf. This, he said, had been brought to
him by the commander of the irregular troops at Selamiyah, who had
been watching my proceedings.</p>

<p>I suggested that he should name an agent to be present as long
as I worked at Nimroud, to take charge of all the precious metals
that might be discovered. He promised to write on the subject to
the chief of the irregulars, but offered no objection to the
continuation of my researches. I returned to Nimroud on the 19th,
increased my workmen to thirty, and divided them into three
parties. The excavations were actively carried on, and an entrance,
or doorway, leading into the interior of the mound, being cleared,
rich results soon rewarded our efforts. In a chamber that the Arabs
unearthed were found two slabs on which were splendid bas-reliefs,
depicting on each a battle scene. In the upper part of the largest
were represented two chariots, each drawn by richly caparisoned
horses at full speed, and containing a group of three warriors, the
principal of which was beardless and evidently a eunuch, grasping a
bow at full stretch.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;"They have Found Nimrod
Himself!"</i></div>

<p>Mohammed Pasha was deposed, and on my return to Mosul, in the
beginning of January, I found Ismail Pasha installed in the
government. My fresh experiments among the ruins speedily led to
the discoveries of extraordinary bas-reliefs. The most perfect of
these represented a king, distinguished by his high, conical
tiara,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">
176</a></span> raising his extended right hand and resting his
left on a bow. At his feet crouched a warrior, probably a captive
or rebel. A eunuch held a fly-flapper over the head of the king,
who appeared to be talking with an officer standing in front of
him, probably his vizir or minister.</p>

<p>The digging of two long trenches led to the discovery of two
more walls with sculptures not well preserved. I abandoned this
part of the mound and resumed excavations in the north-west ruins
near the chamber first opened, where the slabs were uninjured. In
two days the workmen reached the top of an entire slab, standing in
its original position. In a few hours the earth was completely
removed, and there stood to view, to my great satisfaction, two
colossal human figures, carved in low relief and in admirable
preservation.</p>

<p>The figures were back to back, and from the shoulders of each
sprang two wings. They appeared to represent divinities, presiding
over seasons. One carried a fallow deer on his right arm, and in
his left a branch bearing five flowers. The other held a square
vessel or basket in the left hand, and an object resembling a fir
cone in his right.</p>

<p>On the morning following these discoveries some of the Arab
workmen came towards me in the utmost excitement, exclaiming:
"Hasten to the diggers, for they have found Nimrod himself! Wallah!
it is wonderful, but we have seen him with our own eyes. There is
no God but God." On reaching the trench I found unearthed an
enormous human head sculptured out of the alabaster of the
country.</p>

<p>They had uncovered the upper part of a figure, the remainder of
which was still buried in the earth. I saw at once that the head
must belong to a winged bull or lion, similar to those at Khorsabad
and Persepolis. It was in admirable preservation. I was not
surprised that the Arabs had been amazed and terrified at this
apparition. They declared that this was one of the giants whom<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">
177</a></span> Noah cursed before the flood, and was not the work
of men's hands at all. By the end of March I unearthed several
other such colossal figures. They were about twelve feet high and
twelve feet long.</p>

<p>I used to contemplate for hours these mysterious emblems, and
muse over their intent and history. What more noble forms could
have ushered the people into the temples of their gods? They formed
the avenue to the portals. For twenty-five centuries they had been
hidden from the eye of man, and now they stood forth once more in
their ancient majesty.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Unearthing the Palaces of
Assyria</i></div>

<p>As the discoveries proceeded in several successive seasons, they
threw vivid light on the manners and customs of the Assyrians. My
working parties were distributed over the mound, in the ruins of
the north-west and south-west palaces; near the gigantic bulls in
the centre, and in the south-east corner, where no traces of
buildings had as yet been discovered.</p>

<p>I was anxious to pack some of the slabs, which were of the
highest interest, to England. They represented the wars of the king
and his victories over foreign nations. Above him was the emblem of
the supreme deity, represented, as at Persepolis, by a winged man
within a circle, and wearing a horned cap resembling that of the
human-headed lions. Like the king, he was shooting an arrow, the
head of which was in the form of a trident.</p>

<p>Four bas-reliefs, representing a battle, were especially
illustrative of Assyrian customs. A eunuch is seen commanding in
war, as we have before seen him ministering to the king at
religious ceremonies, or waiting on him as his arms-bearer during
peace. Judging from the slabs, cavalry must have formed a large and
important portion of the Assyrian armies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>The lower series of bas-reliefs contained three subjects: the
siege of a castle, the king receiving prisoners, and the king with
his army crossing a river. To the castle, the besiegers had brought
a battering-ram, which two warriors were seeking to hold in its
place by hooks, this part of the bas-relief illustrating the
account in the Book of Chronicles and in Josephus of the machine
for battering walls, instruments to cast stones, and
grappling-irons made by Uzziah.</p>

<p>A cargo of sculptures had already been sent to England for the
British Museum, and by the middle of December a second was ready to
be dispatched on the river to Baghdad.</p>

<p>When the excavations were recommenced after Christmas eight
chambers had been discovered. There were now so many outlets and
entrances that I had no trouble in finding new chambers, one
leading into another. By the end of April I had uncovered almost
the whole building, and had opened twenty-eight halls and rooms
cased with alabaster slabs.</p>

<p>The colossal figure of a woman with four wings, carrying a
garland, now in the British Museum, was discovered in a chamber on
the south side of the palace, as was also the fine bas-relief of
the king leaning on a wand, one of the best-preserved and most
highly finished specimens of Assyrian sculpture in the national
collection.</p>

<p>In the centre of the palace was a great hall, or rather court,
for it had probably been without a roof and open to the air, with
entrances on the four sides, each formed by colossal human-headed
lions and bulls. To the south of this hall was a cluster of small
chambers, opening into each other. At the entrance to one of them
were two winged human figures wearing garlands, and carrying a wild
goat and an ear of corn.</p>

<p>In another chamber were discovered a number of beautiful ivory
ornaments, now in the British Museum. On<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span> two slabs,
forming an entrance to a small chamber in this part of the
building, some inscriptions containing the name of Sargon, the king
who built the Khorsabad palace. They had been cut above the
standard inscription, to which they were evidently posterior.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Kouyunjik</i></div>

<p>Having finished my work at Nimroud, I turned my attention to
Kouyunjik. The term means in Turkish "the little sheep." The great
mount is situated on the plain near the junction of the Khausser
and the Tigris, the former winding round its base and then making
its way into the great stream.</p>

<p>The French consul had carried on desultory excavations some
years at Kouyunjik, without finding any traces of buildings. I set
my workmen commencing operations by the proper method of digging
deep trenches. One morning, as I was at Mosul, two Arab women came
to me and announced that sculptures had been discovered.</p>

<p>I rode to the ruins, and found that a wall and the remains of an
entrance had been reached. The wall proved to be one side of a
chamber. By following it, we reached an entrance, formed by winged
human-headed bulls, leading into a second hall. In a month nine
halls and chambers had been explored. In its architecture the newly
discovered edifice resembled the palaces of Nimroud and Khorsabad.
The halls were long and narrow, the walls of unbaked brick and
panelled with sculptured slabs.</p>

<p>The king whose name is on the sculptures and bricks from
Kouyunjik was the father of Esarhaddon, the builder of the
south-west palace at Nimroud, and the son of Sargon, the Khorsabad
king, and is now generally admitted to be Sennacherib.</p>

<p>By the middle of the month of June my labours in Assyria drew to
a close. The time assigned for the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span> excavations had been
expended, and further researches were not contemplated for the
present. I prepared, therefore, to turn my steps homeward after an
absence of many years. The ruins of Nimroud had been again covered
up, and its palaces were once more hidden from the eye.</p>

<h4>CAROLUS LINN&AElig;US</h4>

<h4>A Tour in Lapland</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;A Wandering Scientist</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Carolus Linn&aelig;us, the celebrated Swedish naturalist, was
born at Rashult on May 23, 1707. At school his taste for botany was
encouraged, but after an unsatisfactory academic career his father
decided to apprentice him to a tradesman. A doctor called Rothmann,
however, recognised and fostered his scientific talents, and in
1728, on Rothmann's advice, he went to Upsala and studied under the
celebrated Rudbeck. In 1732 he made his famous tour in Lapland. He
gives a fascinating account of this journey in "A Tour in Lapland"
("Lachesis Lapponica"), published in 1737. In 1739 he was appointed
a naval physician, and in 1741 became professor of medicine at the
University of Upsal, but in the following year exchanged his chair
for that of botany. To Linn&aelig;us is due the honour of having
first enunciated the true principles for defining genera and
species, and that honour will last so long as biology itself
endures. He found biology a chaos; he left it a cosmos. He died on
January 10, 1778. Among his published works are "Systema
Natur&aelig;," "Fundamenta Botanica," and the "Species
Plantarum."</p>
</div>

<p>Having been appointed by the Royal Academy of Sciences to travel
through Lapland for the purpose of investigating the three kingdoms
of nature in that country, I prepared my wearing apparel and other
necessaries for the journey.</p>

<p>I carried a small leather bag, half an ell in length, but
somewhat less in breadth, furnished on one side with hooks and
eyes, so that it could be opened and shut at pleasure. This bag
contained one shirt, two pairs of false sleeves, two half shirts,
an inkstand, pencase, microscope, and spying glass, a gauze cap to
protect me occasionally from the gnats, a comb, my journal, and a
parcel of paper stitched together for drying plants, both in folio;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">
182</a></span> my manuscript ornithology, <i>Flora Uplandica</i>,
and <i>Characteres generici</i>. I wore a hanger at my side, and
carried a small fowling-piece, as well as an octangular stick,
graduated for the purpose of measuring.</p>

<p>I set out alone from the city of Upsal on Friday, May 22, 1732,
at eleven o'clock, being at that time within half a day of
twenty-five years of age.</p>

<p>At this season nature wore her most cheerful and delightful
aspect, and Flora celebrated her nuptials with Ph&oelig;bus. The
winter corn was half a foot in height, and the barley had just shot
out its blade. The birch, the elm, and the aspen-tree began to put
forth their leaves.</p>

<p>A number of mares with their colts were grazing everywhere near
the road. I remarked the great length of the colts' legs, which,
according to common opinion, are as long at their birth as they
will ever be. I noticed young kids, under whose chin, at the
beginning of the throat, were a pair of tubercles, like those seen
in pigs, about an inch long, and clothed with a few scattered
hairs. Of their use I am ignorant. The forest abounded with the
yellow anemone (<i>Anemone ranunculoides</i>), which many people
consider as differing from that genus. One would suppose they had
never seen an anemone at all. Here, also, grew hepatica, and wood
sorrel. Their blossoms were all closed. Who has endowed plants with
intelligence to shut themselves up at the approach of rain? Even
when the weather changes in a moment from sunshine to rain they
immediately close.</p>

<p>Near the great river Linsnan I found blood-red stones. On
rubbing them I found the red colour external and distinct from the
stone; in fact, it was a red byssus.</p>

<p>At En&auml;nger the people seemed somewhat larger in stature
than in other places, especially the men. I inquired whether the
children are kept longer at the breast than is usual with us, and
was answered in the affirmative. They are allowed that nourishment
more than twice as long as in other places. I have a notion that
Adam and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">
183</a></span> Eve were giants, and that mankind from one
generation to another, owing to poverty and other causes, have
diminished in size. Hence, perhaps, the diminutive stature of the
Laplanders.</p>

<p>The old tradition that the inhabitants of Helsingland never have
the ague is untrue, since I heard of many cases.</p>

<p>Between the post-house of Iggsund and Hudwiksvall a
violet-coloured clay is found in abundance, forming a regular
stratum. I observed it likewise in a hill, the strata of which
consisted of two or three fingers' breadths of common vegetable
mould, then from four to six inches of barren sand, next about a
span of the violet clay, and lastly, barren sand. The clay
contained small and delicately smooth white bivalve shells, quite
entire, as well as some larger brown ones, of which great
quantities are to be found near the waterside. I am therefore
convinced that all these valleys and marshes have formerly been
under water, and that the highest hills only then rose above it. At
this spot grows the <i>Anemone hepatica</i> with a purple flower; a
variety so very rare in other places that I should almost be of the
opinion of the gardeners, who believe the colours of particular
earths may be communicated to flowers.</p>

<p>On May 21 I found at Natra some fields cultivated in an
extraordinary manner. After the field had lain fallow three or four
years, it is sown with one part rye and two parts barley, mixed
together. The barley ripens, and is reaped. The rye, meantime, goes
into leaf, but shoots up no stem, since it is smothered by the
barley. After the barley has been reaped, however, the rye grows
and ripens the following year, producing an abundant crop.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Lapland Customs</i></div>

<p>The Laplanders of Lycksele prepare a kind of curd or cheese from
the milk of the reindeer and the leaves of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span> sorrel. They boil
these leaves in a copper vessel, adding one-third part water,
stirring it continually with a ladle that it may not burn, and
adding fresh leaves from time to time till the whole acquires the
consistence of a syrup. This takes six or seven hours, after which
it is set by to cool, and is then mixed with the milk, and
preserved for use from autumn till the ensuing summer in wooden
vessels, or in the first stomach of the reindeer. It is stored
either in the caves of the mountains or in holes dug in the ground,
lest it should be attacked by the mountain mice.</p>

<p>In Angermanland the people eat sour milk prepared in the
following manner. After the milk is turned, and the curd taken out,
the whey is put into a vessel, where it remains till it becomes
sour. Immediately after the making of cheese, fresh whey is poured
lukewarm on the former sour whey. This is repeated several times,
care being always taken that the fresh whey be lukewarm. This
prepared milk is esteemed a great dainty by the country people.
They consider it as very cooling and refreshing. Sometimes it is
eaten along with fresh milk. Intermittent fevers would not be so
rare here as they are if they could be produced by acid diet, for
then this food must infallibly occasion them.</p>

<p>In Westbothland one of the peasants had shot a young beaver,
which fell under my examination. It was a foot and a half long,
exclusive of the tail, which was a palm in length and two inches
and a half in breadth. The hairs on the back were longer than the
rest; the external ones brownish black, the inner pale brown; the
belly clothed with short, dark-brown fur; body depressed; ears
obtuse, clothed with fine short hairs and destitute of any
accessory lobe; snout blunt, with round nostrils; upper lip cloven
as far as the nostrils; lower very short; the whiskers black, long,
and stout; eyebrow of three bristles like the whiskers over each
eye; neck, none. The fur of the belly was distinguished from that
of the sides<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id=
"Page_185">185</a></span> by a line on each side, in which the
skin was visible. Feet clothed with very short hairs, quite
different from those of the body. A fleshy integument invested the
whole body. There were two cutting teeth in each jaw, of which the
upper pair were the shortest, and notched at the summit like steps;
the lower and larger pair were sloped off obliquely&mdash;grinders
very far remote from the fore-teeth, which is characteristic of the
animal, four on each side; hind feet webbed, but fore feet with
separate claws; tail flat, oblong, obtuse, with a reticulated naked
surface.</p>

<p>At Lycksele was a woman supposed to have a brood of frogs in her
stomach, owing to drinking water containing frogs' spawn. She
thought she could feel three of them, and that she and those beside
her could hear them croak. Her uneasiness was alleviated by
drinking brandy. Salt had no effect in killing the frogs, and even
<i>nux vomica</i>, which had cured another case of the same kind,
was useless. I advised her to try tar, but she had already tried it
in vain.</p>

<p>The Lycksele Laplanders are subject, when they are compelled to
drink the warm sea water, to <i>allem</i>, or colic, for which they
use soot, snuff, salt, and other remedies. They also suffer from
asthma, epilepsy, pleurisy, and rheumatism. Fever and small-pox are
rare. They cure coughs by sulphur laid on burning fungus.</p>

<p>On June 3, being lost amid marshes, I sent a man to obtain a
guide. About two in the afternoon he returned, accompanied by an
extraordinary creature. I can scarce believe that any practical
description of a fury could come up to the idea which this Lapland
fair one excited. It might well be imagined she was really of
Stygian origin. Her stature was very diminutive; her face of the
darkest brown, from the effects of smoke; her eyes dark and
sparkling; her eyebrows black. Her pitchy-coloured hair hung loose
about her head, and she wore a flat, red cap.</p>

<p><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>Though a fury in appearance, she addressed me with mingled pity
and reserve.</p>

<p>I inquired how far it was to Sorsele.</p>

<p>"That we do not know," replied she; "but in the present state of
the roads it is at least seven days' journey, as my husband has
told me."</p>

<p>I was exhausted and famishing. How I longed to meet once more
people who feed on spoon-meat! I inquired of the woman if she could
give me food. She replied that she could give me only fish, but
finding the fish full of maggots, I could not touch it. On arriving
at her hut, however, I perceived three cheeses, and succeeded in
buying the smallest. Then I returned through the marshes the way I
came.</p>

<p>I remarked that all the women hereabouts feed their infants by
means of a horn; nor do they take the trouble of boiling the milk,
so it is no wonder the children have worms. I could not help being
astonished that these peasants did not suckle their children.</p>

<p>Near the road I saw the under-jaw of a horse, having six
fore-teeth, much worn and blunted; two canine teeth; and at a
distance from the latter twelve grinders, six on each side. If I
knew how many teeth, and of what peculiar form, as well as how many
udders and where situated, each animal has, I should perhaps be
able to contrive a most natural methodical arrangement of
quadrupeds. [This observation seems to record the first idea of the
Linn&aelig;an system of the order of the mammalia.]</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Ignorance Incorrigible</i></div>

<p>On June 18 the people brought me a peasant's child, supposed to
have cataract. I concluded that it was not cataract; but noticing
that the eyeballs rolled upwards when the child was spoken to, I
asked the mother whether, when she was with child, she had seen
anybody turn their eyes in that manner. She replied that<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">
187</a></span> she had attended her mother, or mother-in-law, who
was supposed to be dying, whose eyes rolled in a similar fashion.
This was the cause of the infant's misfortune.</p>

<p>At Lulea I was informed of a disease of cattle so pestilential
that though the animals were flayed even before they were cold,
whenever their blood had come in contact with the human body it had
caused gangrenous spots and sores. Some persons had both their
hands swelled, and one his face, in consequence of the blood coming
upon it. Many people had lost their lives by the disease, insomuch
that nobody would now venture to flay any more of the cattle, but
contrived to bury them whole.</p>

<p>On June 30 I arrived at Jockmock, where the curate and
schoolmaster tormented me with their consummate and most
incorrigible ignorance. I could not but wonder that so much pride
and ambition, such scandalous want of information, with such
incorrigible stupidity, could exist in persons of their profession,
who are commonly expected to be men of knowledge. No man will deny
the propriety of such people as these being placed as far as
possible from civilised society.</p>

<p>The learned curate began his conversation by remarking how the
clouds as they strike the mountains carry away stones, trees, and
cattle. I ventured to suggest that such accidents were rather to be
attributed to the force of the wind, since the clouds could not of
themselves carry away anything. He laughed at me, saying surely I
had never seen any clouds. For my part it seemed to me that he
could never have been anywhere but in the clouds. I explained that
when the weather is foggy I walk in clouds, and that when the cloud
is condensed it rains. At all such reasoning, being above his
comprehension, he only laughed with a sardonic smile. Still less
was he satisfied with my explanation how watery bubbles may be
lifted into the air. He insisted that the clouds were solid bodies,
reinforced his assertion with a<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span> text of Scripture,
silenced me by authority, and laughed at my ignorance.</p>

<p>He next condescended to inform me that a phlegm is always to be
found on the mountains where the clouds have touched them. I told
him that the phlegm was a vegetable called nostoc, and he thereupon
concluded that too much learning had turned my brain, and, fully
persuaded of his own complete knowledge of nature, was pleased to
be very facetious at my expense. Finally, he graciously advised me
to pay some regard to the opinions of people skilled in these
abstruse matters, and not to expose myself on my return by
publishing such absurd and preposterous opinions.</p>

<p>Meantime, the pedagogue lamented that people should bestow so
much attention upon temporal vanities, and consequently, alas,
neglect their spiritual good; and he remarked that many a man had
been ruined by too great application to study. Both these wise men
concurred in one thing: they could not conceal their wonder that
the Royal Academy should have appointed a mere student for the
purposes for which I was sent when there were competent men like
themselves in the country ready to undertake the business.</p>

<p>The common method of the Laplanders for joining broken
earthenware is to tie the fragments together with a thread, and
boil the whole in fresh milk, which acts as a cement.</p>

<p>The Laplanders are particularly swift-footed because: They wear
no heels to their half-boots; they are accustomed to run from their
infancy, and habitually exercise their muscles; their muscles are
not stiffened by labour; they eat animal food, and do not overeat;
they are of small stature. They are healthy because they breathe
pure air and drink pure water, eat their food cold and thoroughly
cooked, never overload their stomachs, and have a tranquil
mind.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">
189</a></span><i>IV.&mdash;A Lapland Marriage</i></div>

<p>All the Laplanders are blear-eyed, owing to the sharp wind, the
glare on the snow, fogs, and smoke. Yet I never met any people who
lead such easy, happy lives as the Laplanders. In summer they have
two meals of milk a day, and when they have milked their reindeer
or made cheese, they resign themselves to indolent tranquillity,
not knowing what to do next.</p>

<p>When a Laplander wishes to marry he goes with all his nearest
relatives to the hut of the young woman. He himself remains
outside; but the others, laden with provisions and presents, enter
and begin negotiations. When they are all seated the young man's
father presents some brandy to the young woman's father, and being
asked the reason of the gift, replies: "I am come hither with a
good intention, and I pray God it may prosper." He then declares
his errand, and if his suit is favourably received, the friends of
the lover place the presents&mdash;usually utensils and silver
coins&mdash;on a reindeer skin before the father and mother of the
prospective bride, and the father, or the mother, of the lover
apportions the money to the young woman and her parents. If the
presents are considered satisfactory, the daughter, who has usually
retired to another hut, is sent for.</p>

<p>When the bride enters the hut her father asks her whether she is
satisfied with what he has done. To which she replies that she
submits herself to the disposal of her father, who is the best
judge of what is proper for her. The mother then lays in the
bride's lap the sum apportioned for her. If it proves less than she
expected, she shows her dissatisfaction by various gestures and
signs of refusal, and may possibly obtain at least the promise of a
larger sum.</p>

<p>When such pecuniary matters are finally arranged the father and
mother of the bridegroom present him and his<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
bride with a cup of brandy, of which they partake together, and
then all the company shake hands. Afterwards they take off their
hats, and one of the company makes an oration, praying for God's
blessing upon the newly married couple, and returning thanks to Him
who "gives every man his own wife, and every woman her own
husband."</p>

<p>Then the provisions, which generally consist of several cheeses
and a piece of meat dried and salted, are brought forward, and the
company sit down to feast. The bride and bridegroom are placed
together, and are given the best of the provisions. The company
then serve themselves, taking their meat on the points of their
knives, and dipping each morsel into some of the broth in which it
was boiled.</p>

<p>The dinner being over, the whole company shake hands, return
thanks for the entertainment, and retire to bed. Next morning they
all feed on the remainder of the feast. The banns are usually
published once. The marriage ceremony, which is very short, is
performed after the above-mentioned company has departed.</p>

<p>The tranquil existence of the Laplanders corresponds to Ovid's
description of the golden age, and to the pastoral state as
depicted by Virgil. It recalls the remembrance of the patriarchal
life, and the poetical descriptions of the Elysian fields.</p>

<p>About one o'clock on the afternoon of October 10, I returned
safe to Upsal. To the Maker and Preserver of all things, be praise,
honour, and glory for ever!</p>

<h4>DAVID LIVINGSTONE</h4>

<h4>Missionary Travels and Researches</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Early Experiences</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>David Livingstone was born at Blantyre, on the Clyde (Scotland),
on March 19, 1813, the son of a small tea-dealer. Working as a boy
in a cotton-mill, he learnt Latin by the midnight candle, and later
attended medical and Greek classes at Glasgow University, where he
qualified as doctor of medicine. He sailed as missionary to Africa
in 1840, and worked at Kuruman with Moffat, whose daughter he
married. Setting out to explore the interior in 1849, Livingstone
eventually discovered Lakes Ngami, Shirwa, Dilolo, Bangweolo,
Tanganyika, and Nyassa, and the Rivers Zambesi, Shire, and Kasai,
also the Victoria and Murchison Falls. His scientific researches
were invaluable, his character so pure and brave that he made the
white man respected. Stanley visited and helped him in 1871, but on
May 1, 1873, he died at Ilala, and his remains, carefully preserved
by his native servants, were brought to England and buried with
great honours in Westminster Abbey. His "Missionary Travels and
Researches in South Africa," published during his visit to England
in 1857, make delightful reading, and thoroughly reflect the inmost
character of the man. There is no attempt at literary style; the
story is told with a simplicity and an apparent unconsciousness of
having done anything remarkable that cannot fail to captivate.</p>
</div>

<p>My own inclination would lead me to say as little as possible
about myself. My great-grandfather fell at Culloden, my grandfather
used to tell us national stories, and my grandmother sang Gaelic
songs. To my father and the other children the dying injunction
was, "Now, in my lifetime I have searched most carefully through
all the traditions I could find of our family, and I never could
discover that there was a dishonest man among our forefathers. If,
therefore, any of you or any of your children should take to
dishonest ways, it will not be because it<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span> runs in your
blood, it does not belong to you. I leave this precept with
you&mdash;Be honest."</p>

<p>As a boy I worked at a cotton factory at Blantyre to lessen the
family anxieties, and bought my "Rudiments of Latin" out of my
first week's wages, pursuing the study of that language at an
evening school, followed up till twelve o'clock or later, if my
mother did not interfere by jumping up and snatching the books out
of my hands. Reading everything I could lay my hands on, except
novels, scientific works and books of travel were my especial
delight. Great pains had been taken by my parents to instil the
doctrines of Christianity into my mind. My early desire was to
become a pioneer missionary in China, and eventually I offered my
services to the London Missionary Society, having passed my medical
examination at Glasgow University.</p>

<p>I embarked for Africa in 1840, and from Cape Town travelled up
country seven hundred miles to Kuruman, where I joined Mr. Moffat
in his work, and after four years as a bachelor, I married his
daughter Mary.</p>

<p>Settling among the Mabotsa tribe, I found that they were
troubled with attacks from lions, so one day I went with my gun
into the bush and shot one, but the wounded beast sprang upon me,
and felled me to the ground. While perfectly conscious, I lost all
sense of fear or feeling, and narrowly escaped with my life.
Besides crunching the bone into splinters, he left eleven teeth
wounds on the upper part of my arm.</p>

<p>I attached myself to the tribe called Bakwains, whose chief,
Sechele, a most intelligent man, became my fast friend, and a
convert to Christianity. The Bakwains had many excellent qualities,
which might have been developed by association with European
nations. An adverse influence, however, is exercised by the Boers,
for, while claiming for themselves the title of Christians, they
treat these natives as black property, and their system of domestic
slavery and robbery is a disgrace to the white<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span> man.
For my defence of the rights of Sechele and the Bakwains, I was
treated as conniving at their resistance, and my house was
destroyed, my library, the solace of our solitude, torn to pieces,
my stock of medicines smashed, and our furniture and clothing sold
at public auction to pay the expenses of the foray.</p>

<p>In travelling we sometimes suffered from a scarcity of meat, and
the natives, to show their sympathy for the children, often gave
them caterpillars to eat; but one of the dishes they most enjoyed
was cooked "mathametlo," a large frog, which, during a period of
drought, takes refuge in a hole in the root of certain bushes, and
over the orifice a large variety of spider weaves its web. The
scavenger-beetle, which keeps the Kuruman villages sweet and clean,
rolls the dirt into a ball, and carries it, like Atlas, on its
back.</p>

<p>In passing across the great Kalahari desert we met with the
Bushmen, or Bakalahari, who, from dread of visits from strange
tribes, choose their residences far away from water, hiding their
supplies of this necessity for life in pits filled up by women, who
pass every drop through their mouths as a pump, using a straw to
guide the stream into the vessel. They will never disclose this
supply to strangers, but by sitting down and waiting with patience
until the villagers were led to form a favourable opinion of us, a
woman would bring out a shell full of the precious fluid from I
knew not where.</p>

<p>At Nchokotsa we came upon a number of salt-pans, which, in the
setting sun, produced a most beautiful mirage as of distant water,
foliage, and animals. We discovered the river Zouga, and
eventually, on August 1, 1849, we were the first Europeans to gaze
upon the broad waters of Lake Ngami. My chief object in coming to
this lake was to visit Sebituane, the great chief of the Makololo,
a man of immense influence, who had conquered the black tribes of
the country and made himself dreaded even by the terrible
Mosilikatse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194">194</a></span>During our stay with him he treated us with great respect, and
was pleased with the confidence we had shown in bringing our
children to him. He was stricken with inflammation of the lungs,
and knew it meant death, though his native doctors said, "Sebituane
can never die." I visited him with my little boy Robert. "Come
near," said he, "and see if I am any longer a man. I am done."
After sitting with him some time and commending him to the mercy of
God, I rose to depart, when the dying chieftain, raising himself up
a little from his prone position, called a servant, and said, "Take
Robert to Maunku (one of his wives), and tell her to give him some
milk." These were the last words of Sebituane.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Among the Makololo</i></div>

<p>On questioning intelligent men amongst these natives as to a
knowledge of good and evil, of God and the future state, they
possessed a tolerably clear perception on these subjects. Their
want, however, of any form of public worship, or of idols, or of
formal prayers and sacrifices, make both the Caffres and Bechuanas
appear as amongst the most godless races of mortals known anywhere.
When an old Bushman on one occasion was sitting by the fire
relating his adventures, including his murder of five other
natives, he was remonstrated with. "What will God say when you
appear before Him?" "He will say," replied he, "that I was a very
clever fellow." But I found afterwards in speaking of the Deity
they had only the idea of a chief, and when I knew this, I did not
make any mistake afterwards.</p>

<p>The country round Unku was covered with grass, and the flowers
were in full bloom. The thermometer in the shade generally stood at
98 deg. from 1 to 3 p.m., but it sank as low as 65 deg. by night,
so that the heat was by no means exhausting. At the surface of the
ground in the sun it marked 125 deg., and three inches below
138<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">
195</a></span> deg. The hand cannot be held on the ground, and
even the horny soles of the natives are protected by hide sandals,
yet the ants were busy working in it. The water in the floods was
as high as 100 deg., but as water does not conduct heat readily
downwards, deliriously cool water may be obtained by anyone walking
into the middle and lifting up the water from the bottom to the
surface by the hands.</p>

<p>We at last reached a spot where, by climbing the highest tree,
we could see a fine large sheet of water, surrounded on all sides
by an impenetrable belt of reeds. This was the river Chobe, and is
called Zambesi. We struggled through the high, serrated grass, the
heat stifling for want of air, and when we reached one of the
islands, my strong moleskins were worn through at the knees, and
the leather trousers of my companion were torn, and his legs
bleeding. The Makololo said in their figurative language: "He has
dropped among us from the clouds, yet came riding on the back of a
hippopotamus. We Makololo thought no one could cross the Chobe
without our knowledge, but here he drops among us like a bird."</p>

<p>On our arrival at Linyanti, the capital, the chief, Sekelutu,
took me aside and pressed me to mention those things I liked best
and hoped to get from him. Anything either in or out of the town
should be freely given if I would only mention it. I explained to
him that my object was to elevate him and his people to be
Christians; but he replied that he did not wish to learn to read
the Book, for he was afraid "it might change his heart and make him
content with one wife like Sechele." I liked the frankness of
Sekelutu, for nothing is so wearying to the spirit as talking to
those who agree with everything advanced.</p>

<p>While at Linyanti I was taken with fever, from chills caught by
leaving my warm wagon in the evening to conduct family worship at
my people's fires. Anxious to ascertain whether the natives
possessed the knowledge of any remedy, I sent for one of their
doctors. He put some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id=
"Page_196">196</a></span> roots into a pot with water, and
when it was boiling, placed it beneath a blanket thrown around both
me and it. This produced no effect, and after being stewed in their
vapour baths, smoked like a red-herring over green twigs, and
charmed <i>secundem artem</i>, I concluded I could cure my fever
more quickly than they could.</p>

<p>Leaving Linyanti, we passed up the Lecambye river into the
Barotse country, and on making inquiries whether Santuru, the
Moloiana, had ever been visited by white men, I could find no
vestige of any such visit before my arrival in 1851.</p>

<p>In our ascent up the River Leeba, we reached the village of
Manenko, a female chief, of whose power of tongue we soon had ample
proof. She was a woman of fine physique, and insisted on
accompanying us some distance with her husband and drummer, the
latter thumping most vigorously, until a heavy, drizzling mist set
in and compelled him to desist. Her husband used various
incantations and vociferations to drive away the rain, but down it
poured incessantly, and on our Amazon went, in the very lightest
marching order, and at a pace that few men could keep up with.
Being on ox-back, I kept pretty close to our leader, and asked her
why she did not clothe herself during the rain, and learnt that it
is not considered proper for a chief to appear effeminate. My men,
in admiration of her pedestrian powers, every now and then
remarked, "Manenko is a soldier!" Thoroughly wet and cold, we were
all glad when she proposed a halt to prepare for our night's
lodging on the banks of a stream.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Peril and Patience</i></div>

<p>When we arrived at the foot of the Kasai we were badly in want
of food, and there seemed little hope of getting any; one of our
guides, however, caught a light-blue mole and two mice for his
supper. Katende, the chief, sent for me the following morning, and
on my walking into his hut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197"
id="Page_197">197</a></span> I was told that he wanted a man,
a tusk, beads, copper rings, and a shell as payment for leave to
pass through his country. Having humbly explained our circumstances
and that he could not expect to "catch a humble cow by the
horns"&mdash;a proverb similar to ours that "You cannot draw milk
out of a stone"&mdash;we were told to go home, and he would speak
to us next day. I could not avoid a hearty laugh at the cool
impudence of the savage. Eventually I sent him one of my worst
shirts, but added that when I should reach my own chief naked, and
was asked what I had done with my clothes, I should be obliged to
confess I had left them with Katende.</p>

<p>Passing onwards, we crossed a small rivulet, the Sengko, and
another and larger one with a bridge over it. At the farther end of
this structure stood a negro who demanded fees. He said the bridge
was his, the guides were his children, and if we did not pay him,
he would prevent further progress. This piece of civilisation I was
not prepared to meet, and stood a few seconds looking at our bold
toll-keeper, when one of our men took off three copper bracelets,
which paid for the whole party. The negro was a better man than he
at first seemed, for he immediately went into his garden and
brought us some leaves of tobacco as a present.</p>

<p>We were brought to a stand on the banks of the Loajima, a
tributary of the Kasai, by the severity of my fever, being in a
state of partial coma, until late at night, I found we were in the
midst of enemies; and the Chiboque natives insisting upon a
present, I had to give them a tired-out ox. Later on we marched
through the gloomy forest in gloomier silence; the thick atmosphere
prevented my seeing the creeping plants in time to avoid them; I
was often caught, and as there is no stopping the oxen when they
have the prospect of giving the rider a tumble, came frequently to
the ground. In addition to these mishaps, my ox Sinbad went off at
a plunging gallop, the bridle broke, and I came down behind on the
crown of my head. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id=
"Page_198">198</a></span> gave me a kick in the thigh at the
same time. I felt none the worse for this rough treatment, but
would not recommend it to others as a palliative in cases of
fever.</p>

<p>We shortly afterwards met a hostile party of natives, who
refused us further passage. Seeing that these people had plenty of
iron-headed arrows and some guns, I called a halt, and ordered my
men to put the luggage in the centre in case of actual attack. I
then dismounted, and advancing a little towards our principal
opponent, showed him how easily I could kill him, but pointed
upwards, saying, "I fear God." He did the same, placing his hand on
his heart, pointing upwards, and saying, "I fear to kill, but come
to our village; come, do come."</p>

<p>During these exciting scenes I always forgot my fever, but a
terrible sense of sinking came back with the feeling of safety.
These people stole our beads, and though we offered all our
ornaments and my shirts, they refused us passage. My men were so
disheartened that they proposed a return home, which distressed me
exceedingly. After using all my powers of persuasion, I declared to
them that if they returned, I would go on alone, and went into my
little tent with the mind directed to Him Who hears the sighing of
the soul, and was soon followed by the head of Mohorisi, saying,
"We will never leave you. Do not be disheartened. Wherever you
lead, we will follow. Our remarks were made only on account of the
injustice of these people."</p>

<p>We were soon on the banks of the Quango, and after some
difficulties reached the opposite bank.</p>

<p>The village of Cassenge is composed of thirty or forty traders'
houses on an elevated flat spot in the great Quango, or Cassenge,
valley. As I always preferred to appear in my own proper character,
I was an object of curiosity to the hospitable Portuguese. They
evidently looked upon me as an agent of the English government,
engaged in some new movement for the suppression of slavery. They
could not divine what a "missionario"<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span> had to do with the
latitudes and longitudes which I was intent on observing.</p>

<p>On coming across the plains to Loanda we first beheld the sea;
my companions looked upon the boundless ocean with awe. In
describing their feelings afterwards they remarked, "We marched
along with our father thinking that what the ancients had always
told us was true, that the world has no end, but all at once the
world said to us, 'I am finished, there is no more of me.'"</p>

<p>Here in this city, among its population of 12,000 souls there
was but one genuine English gentleman, who bade me welcome, and
seeing me ill, benevolently offered me his bed. Never shall I
forget the luxuriant pleasure I enjoyed feeling myself again on a
good English couch, after six months sleeping on the ground.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Into the Wilderness
Again</i></div>

<p>For the sake of my Makololo companions I refused the tempting
offer of a passage home in one of her majesty's cruisers.</p>

<p>During my journey through Angola I received at Cassenge a packet
of the "Times" from home with news of the Russian war up to the
terrible charge of the light cavalry. The intense anxiety I felt to
hear more may be imagined by every true patriot.</p>

<p>After leaving the Kasai country, we entered upon a great level
plain, which we had formerly found in a flooded condition. We
forded the Lotembwa on June 8, and found that the little Lake
Dilolo, by giving a portion to our Kasai and another to the
Zambesi, distributes its waters to the Atlantic and Indian oceans.
From information derived from Arabs at Zanzibar, whom I met at
Naliele in the middle of the country, a large shallow lake is
pointed out in the region east of Loanda, named Tanganyenka, which
requires three days in crossing in canoes. It is connected with
another named Kalagwe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200">200</a></span> (Garague?), farther north, and may
be the Nyanja of the Maravim.</p>

<p>Although I was warned that the Batoka tribe would be hostile, I
decided on going down the Zambesi, and on my way I visited the
falls of Victoria, called by the natives Mosioatunya, or more
anciently, Shongwe. No one can imagine the beauty of the view from
anything witnessed in England. It has never been seen before by
European eyes, but scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by
angels in their flight. Five columns of "smoke" arose, bending in
the direction of the wind. The entire falls is simply a crack made
in a hard basaltic rock from the right to the left bank of the
Zambesi, and then prolonged from the left bank away through thirty
or forty miles of hills. The whole scene was extremely beautiful;
the banks and islands dotted over the river are adorned with sylvan
vegetation of great variety of colour and form. At the period of
our visit several of the trees were spangled over with
blossoms.</p>

<p>In due time we reached the confluence of the Loangwa and the
Zambesi, most thankful to God for His great mercies in helping us
thus far. I felt some turmoil of spirit in the evening at the
prospect of having all my efforts for the welfare of this great
region and its teeming population knocked on the head by savages
to-morrow, who might be said to "know not what they do."</p>

<p>When at last we reached within eight miles of Tete I was too
fatigued to go on, but sent the commandant the letters of
recommendation of the bishop and lay down to rest. Next morning two
officers and some soldiers came to fetch us, and when I had
partaken of a good breakfast, though I had just before been too
tired to sleep, all my fatigue vanished. The pleasure of that
breakfast was enhanced by the news that Sebastopol had fallen and
the war finished.</p>

<h4>PIERRE LOTI</h4>

<h4>The Desert</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Arabia Deserta</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Pierre Loti, whose real name is Louis Marie Julien Viaud, and
who has made his whole career in the French navy, was born at
Rochefort on January 14, 1850. Distinguished though his naval
activities have been, it is as a man of letters that Pierre Loti is
known to the world. His first production, "Aziyade," appeared in
1876, and gave ample promise of that style, borrowed from no one
and entirely his own, which has since characterized all his works.
"The Desert," published in 1894, is a masterpiece of a peculiarly
modern kind. Loti leaves to other writers the task of depicting the
Bedouin. The spectacle of nature in her wildest and severest mood
was what he went out to see; and he employs all the resources of
his incomparable genius for description in painting the vacant
immensity of the Arabian wilderness. Tired and distracted by the
whirl and fever of life in Paris, Loti set out, like Tancred, in
Beaconsfield's romance on a pilgrimage from Sinai to Calvary to
recover the faith he had lost in civilisation.</p>
</div>

<p><i>February 22, 1894.</i> All about us was the empty infinitude;
the twilight desert swept by a great cold wind; the desert that
rolled, in dull, dead colours, under a still more sombre sky which,
on the circular horizon, seemed to fall on it and crush it.</p>

<p>Sitting under the palm-tree of the Oasis of Moses, half an
hour's march from the Red Sea, surrounded by our camels and
camel-men, we stared at the desert, and the emotion and the ecstasy
of solitude came over us. We longed to plunge headlong into the
dim, luring immensity, to run with the wind blowing over the
desolate dunes. So we ran, and reaching the heights, we looked down
on a larger wilderness, over which trailed a dying gleam of
daylight, fallen from the yellow sky through a rent made by the
wind in the cloudy veil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">
202</a></span> But so sinister was the desert in the winter wind,
that from some remote, ancestral source of feeling a strange
melancholy welled up and mingled with our desire for the solitude.
In it was the instinctive fear which makes the sheep and cattle of
the green lands retrace their steps at the sight of regions over
which hangs the shadow of death.</p>

<p>But under our tent, lighted and sheltered from the wind, we
recovered our gaiety of mood. There was the novelty of our first
meal in the desert to excite us, and the pleasure of packing up our
ridiculous European costumes, and dressing ourselves in the more
useful and far more decorative burnous and veils of the sheiks of
Arabia.</p>

<p>All the next three days we travelled through a waterless waste,
following a vague trace which, in the course of ages, men and
beasts have made in the dry sand. Far in front the sky-line danced
in the heat. The sand around was strewn with greyish stones;
everything was grey, grey-red or grey-yellow. Here and there was a
plant of a pale green, with an imperceptible flower, and the long
necks of the camels bent and stretched trying to crop it.</p>

<p>Little by little one's mind grows drowsy, lulled by the monotony
of the slow, swinging movement of the tall, indefatigable camel. In
the foreground of the grey scene, one's sleepy, lowered eyes see at
last nothing but the continual undulation of its neck, of the same
grey-yellow as the sand, and the back of its shaggy head, similar
to the little head of a lion, encircled with a barbaric ornament of
white shells and blue pearls, with hangings of black wool.</p>

<p>As we go on, the last signs of life disappear. There is not a
bird, not an insect; even the flies which exist in all the lands of
the earth are not found. While the deserts of the sea contain vital
wealth in profusion, here are sterility and death. Yet one is
intoxicated with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">203</a></span> stillness and lifelessness of it
all, and the air is pure and virginal, blowing from the world
before the creation.</p>

<p>The wind drops, and in an atmosphere of an absolute purity the
sun mounts and burns with a white fire. Under the dazzling light,
one shuts one's eyes in spite of oneself for long periods. When one
opens them, the horizon seems a black circle breaking on the
brightness of the heavens, while the precise spot in which one is
remains astonishingly white. Nothing sings, nothing flies, nothing
stirs. The immense silence is dully broken only by the incessant,
monotonous tread of our slow, swinging camels.</p>

<p>On the fourth day we leave the plain and strike into the
mountainous solitudes of the Sinai peninsula.... As we ascend, vast
new tracts are unrolled on all sides beneath our eyes, and the
impression of the desert becomes more distressing by reason of this
visible affirmation of its illimitableness. It is terrifying in its
magnificence! The limpidity of the air gives an extraordinary depth
to the perspectives, and in the clear and far-receding distances
the chains of mountains are interlaced and overlaid in regular
forms which, from the beginning of the world, have been untouched
by the hand of man, and with hard, dry contours which no vegetation
has ever softened or changed. In the foreground they are of a
reddish brown; then in their flight to the sky-line they pass into
a wonderful tone of violet, which grows bluer and bluer until it
melts into the pure indigo of the extreme distance. And all this is
empty, silent, and dead. It is the splendour of an invariable
region, from which is absent the ephemeral beauty of forest,
verdure, or herbage; the splendour of eternal matter, affranchised
from all the instability of life; the geological splendour of the
world before the creation.</p>

<p>Oh, the sunset this evening! Never have we seen so much gold
poured out for us alone around our lonely camp. Our camels,
wandering beyond our tents, and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span> strangely enlarged
against the vacant horizon, have gold on their heads, on their
legs, on their long necks; they are all edged with gold.</p>

<p>And then night comes, the limpid night with its stillness. If at
this moment one goes away from the camp and loses sight of it, or
even separates oneself from the little handful of living creatures
strayed in the midst of dead space, in order to feel more
absolutely alone in the nocturnal vacancy, one has an impression of
terror in which there is something religious. Less distant, less
inaccessible than elsewhere, the stars blaze in the depths of the
cosmic abysses; and in this desert, unchangeable and untouched by
time, from which one looks at them, one feels oneself nearer to
conceiving their inconceivable infinity; one has almost the
illusion of sharing in their starry duration, their starry
impassibility.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Habitation of
Solitude</i></div>

<p><i>March 1.</i> After climbing two days in snow, thunder, and
tempest, we see at last, amid the dim, cloudy peaks of granite, the
tall ramparts and the cypress trees of the convent of Sinai. Alas!
how silent, sinister, and chill appears the holy mountain, whose
name alone still flames for us in the distance. It is as empty as
the sky above our heads.</p>

<p>Trembling with the cold in our thin, wet burnous, we alight from
our camels, that suffer and complain, disquieted by the white
obscurity, the lashing wind, the strange, wild altitude. For twenty
minutes we clamber by lantern light among blocks and falls of
granite, with bare feet that slip at every step on the snow. Then
we reach a gigantic wall, the summit of which is lost in darkness,
and a little low door, covered with iron, opens. We pass in. Two
more doors of a smaller kind lead through a vaulted tunnel in the
rampart. They close behind us with the clang of armour, and we
creep up some flights<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id=
"Page_205">205</a></span> of rough, broken stairs, hewed out
of the rock, to a hostel for pilgrims at the top of the great
fortress.</p>

<p>Some hospitable monks in black robes, and with long hair like
women, hasten to cheer us with a little hot coffee and a little
lighted charcoal, carried in a copper vase. Everything has an air
of nonchalant wretchedness and Oriental dilapidation in this
convent built by the Emperor Justinian fourteen centuries ago. Our
bare, whitewashed bedrooms are like the humblest of Turkish
dwellings, save for the modest icon above the divan, with a
night-light burning before it. The little chamber is covered with
the names of pilgrims gathered from the ends of the earth; Russian,
Arabian, and Greek inscriptions predominate.</p>

<p>Aroused by a jet of clear sunlight, and surprised by the
strangeness of the place, I ran to the balcony; there I still
marvelled to find the fantastic things seen by glimpses last night,
standing real and curiously distinct in the implacable white light,
but arranged in an unreal way, as if inset into each other without
perspective, so pure is the atmosphere&mdash;and all silent, silent
as if they were dead of their extreme old age. A Byzantine church,
a mosque, cots, cloisters, an entanglement of stairways, galleries,
and arches falling to the precipices below: all this in miniature;
built up in a tiny space; all this encompassed with formidable
ramparts, and hooked on to the flanks of gigantic Sinai! From the
sharpness and thinness of the air, we know that we are at an
excessive height, and yet we seem to be at the bottom of a well. On
every side the extreme peaks of Sinai enclose us, as they mount and
scale the sky; their titanic walls, all of blood-red granite
without stain or shadow, are so vertical and so high that they
dizzy and appal. Only a fragment of the sky is visible, but its
blueness is of a profound transparency, and the sun is magnificent.
And still the same eerie silence envelops the phantom-like
monastery, whose antiquity is accentuated under the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
cold, dazzling sunlight and the sparkling snow. One feels that it
is verily "the habitation of solitude," encompassed by the great
wildernesses.</p>

<p>Its situation has preserved it from the revolutions, the wars,
and the changing fashions of the world. Almost everything remains
just as it was built in 550 by Justinian. And when one of the
long-haired monks shows us the marvellous treasures of the
basilica&mdash;a dim, richly barbaric structure, filled with
priceless offerings from the ancient kings of the earth&mdash;we no
longer wonder at the enormous height and thickness of the ramparts
which protect the convent from the Bedouins.</p>

<p>Behind the tabernacle of the basilica is the holy place of
Sinai&mdash;the crypt of the "Burning Bush." It is a sombre cavern
lined with antique tiles of a dim blue-green, which are hidden
under the icons of gold and precious stone attached to the walls,
and under the profusion of gold and silver lamps hanging from the
low roof. Rigid saints in vermilion robes, whose faces are
concealed in the dark shadow of their barbaric glistening crowns,
looked at us as we entered. We stepped in reverently, on bare feet,
and never, in any place, did we have so entire an impression of a
recoil into the long past ages of the world.</p>

<p>Peoples and empires have passed away, while these precious
things slowly tarnished in this dim crypt. Even the monk who
accompanies us resembles, with his long red hair falling over his
shoulders, and the pale beauty of his ascetic face, the mystics of
the early ages; and his thoughts are infinitely removed from ours.
And the vague reflection of sunlight which arrives through a
single, little window in the thick wall, and falls in a circle of
ghostly radiance on the icons and mosaics, seems to be some gleam
from an ancient day, some gleam from an age far different from the
sordid, impious century in which we live.</p>

<p>A kind of lodge, paved with chiselled silver, and hung<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">
207</a></span> with lighted lamps, rises in the depth of the
crypt; it is there that, according to the venerated tradition, the
<i>Angel of the Eternal</i> appeared to Moses in the midst of the
burning bush.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Where Nothing Changes</i></div>

<p><i>March 16.</i> We have now left the blue lonely waters and the
red granite cliffs of the Gulf of Akaba, and entered the great
desert of Tih, the solitudes of which, our camel-men say, are as
immense and as flat as the sea, and the scene of incessant mirages.
It is peopled by a few tribes of savage Bedouins, descended from
the Amalekites. This is the land in which nothing changes: the true
Orient, immutable in its dust and its dreams. Behind the barren
hill on which we have camped, Arabia Deserta unrolls the infinite
tract of its red desolation. On our right is the wild wilderness of
Petra and the sinister mountains of the land of Edom. In front
stretches the gloomier waste of the plateau of Tih.</p>

<p>From the spot on which we stand, light tracks, made by the
regular movement of caravans, run out into the distance,
innumerable as the threads in a weaver's loom. They form two rays:
one dies away into the west, the other into the north. The first is
the route of the believers coming from Egypt and Morocco; the
second, which we are about to follow, is the path of the pilgrims
from Syria to Palestine. This wild crossway of the desert, along
which pass every year crowds of twenty or thirty thousand men
marching to the holy city of Mecca, is now empty, infinitely empty,
and the mournful, vacant grandeur which it wears under the sombre
sky is terrible. The habitual halting-place of multitudes, it is
strewn with tombstones, little rough, unhewn blocks, one at the
head, the other at the feet&mdash;places in which the pious
pilgrims who passed by have laid down to rest for eternity.</p>

<p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">
208</a></span>Our dromedaries, excited by the wide, open space in front of
them, raise their heads and scent the wind, and then change their
languid gait into something that becomes almost a race. It is of a
mud-grey colour, this desert that calls to them, and as even as a
lawn. As far as the eye can reach, no change is seen in it, and it
is gloomy under a still gloomier sky. It has almost the shimmer of
something humid, but its immense surface is all made of dry mud,
broken and marked like crackled porcelain.</p>

<p>The next day the colour of the wilderness changes from muddy
grey to deep black, and the sun soared up, white-hot, in a clear
blue sky. The empty, level distances trembled in the heat, and
seemed to be preparing for all sorts of visions and mirages.</p>

<p>"Gazal! Gazal!" (gazelles) cried the sheik. They were passing in
an opposite course to ours, like a whirl of sand, little creatures
slenderly fine, little creatures timid and quick in flight. But the
moving, troubled air altered their images and juggled them away
from our defeated eyes.</p>

<p>Then the first phantom lake appeared, and deceived even the
Bedouin chief&mdash;the water was so blue, and the shadows of a
border of palm-trees seemed to be reflected in it. And very soon
the tempting waters show on all sides, retreating before us,
changing their shapes, spreading out, going away, coming back;
large lakes or winding rivers or little ponds edged with imaginary
reeds. Every minute they increase, and it seems like a sea which
little by little gains on us&mdash;a disquieting sea that trembles.
But at noon all this blue phantasmagoria vanishes abruptly, as if
it were blown away at a breath. There is nothing but dried sands.
Clear, real, implacable, reappears the land of thirst and
death.</p>

<p><i>Easter Sunday, March 25, 1894.</i> We were awakened this
morning by the singing of the larks. After travelling for three
hours, look, here are some trees&mdash;the first we<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span> have
seen&mdash;a long valley full of trees; and there, on the far
sky-line, is the blue edge of the sea. And at last Gaza, with its
white minarets and grey houses; Gaza, in the midst of its gardens
and its woods; Gaza, that seems a sumptuous city to us poor
wanderers of the desert!</p>

<p>The moon is high. It is the hour that our Bedouins depart.
Seated on their tall swinging beasts, the sheiks go by, and wave to
us a friendly farewell. They are returning to the terrible land
where they were born and where they love to live, and their
departure brings to an end our dream of the desert. To-morrow, at
break of day, we shall ascend towards Jerusalem.</p>

<h4>SIR JOHN MANDEVILLE</h4>

<h4>Voyage and Travel</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Of the Holy Land and the Way
Thereto</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The celebrated "Voyage and Travel of Sir John Mandeville" was
first published in French between 1357 and 1371. The identity of
its author has given rise to much difference of opinion, but its
authorship is now generally ascribed to Jehan de Bourgoigne, a
physician who practised at Li&egrave;ge. There is, indeed, some
evidence that this name was assumed, and that the physician's real
name, Mandeville, had been discarded when he fled from England
after committing homicide. A tomb at Li&egrave;ge, seen at so late
as the seventeenth century, bore the name of Mandeville, and gave
the date of his death as November 17, 1372. As to the book itself,
its material is evidently borrowed chiefly from other writers,
especially from the account of the travels of Friar Odoric and from
a French work on the East, and only a small part contains
first-hand information. Numerous manuscripts exist, in several
languages. The English version is probably not the work of the
original writer, but it is, nevertheless, regarded as a standard
piece of medi&aelig;val English prose.</p>
</div>

<p>For as much as the land beyond the sea, that is to say, the Holy
Land, passing all other lands, is the most worthy land, most
excellent, and Lady and Sovereign of all other lands, and is
blessed and hallowed of the precious Body and Blood of our Lord
Jesus Christ; and that land He chose before all other lands as the
best and most worthy land, and the most virtuous land of all the
world; wherefore, every good Christian man, that is of power, and
hath whereof, should strive with all his strength for to conquer
our right heritage, and chase out all misbelieving men. And for as
much as many men desire to hear speak of the Holy Land, I, John
Mandeville, Knight, albeit I be not worthy, that was born in
England, in the town of Saint Albans, passed the sea, in the year
of our Lord Jesus Christ 1322, on the day of Saint Michael, and
hitherto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">
211</a></span> have been a long time over the sea, and have seen
and gone through many divers lands. And I shall devise you some
part of things that there be, when time shall be, after it may best
come to my mind; and specially for them that are in purpose for to
visit the Holy City of Jerusalem, and I shall tell the way that
they should hold thither. For I have oftentimes passed and ridden
that way, with good company of many lords; God be thanked.</p>

<p>In the name of God, glorious and almighty, he that will pass
over the sea to go to the city of Jerusalem, if he come from the
west side of the world, as from England, he may and he will go
through Almayne and through the kingdom of Hungary, that marcheth
to the land of Polayne. And after go men to Belgrave and enter into
the land of Bourgres, and through the land of Pyncemartz, and come
to Greece, and so to the city of Constantynoble. And there dwelleth
commonly the Emperor of Greece. And there is the most fair church
and the most noble of all the world; and it is of Saint Sophie.
From Constantynoble he that will go by water goeth to an isle that
is clept Sylo, and then to the isle of Patmos.</p>

<p>From Patmos men go into Ephesus, a fair city and nigh to the
sea. And there died Saint John, and was buried behind the high
altar, in a tomb. And in the tomb of Saint John is nought but
manna, that is clept angels' meat. For his body was translated into
Paradise. And Turks hold now all that place, and the city and the
church. And all Asia the less is clept Turkey. And ye shall
understand that St. John made his grave there in his life, and laid
himself therein all quick. And therefore some men say that he died
not, but that he resteth there till the Day of Doom. And forsooth
there is a great marvel, for men may see there the earth of the
tomb apertly many times stir and move, as there were quick things
under.</p>

<p>And from Ephesus men go through many isles in the sea, and to
the isle of Crete, and through the isles of Colos and of Lango, of
the which isles Ypocras was lord. And<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span> some men say that in
the isle of Lango is yet the daughter of Ypocras, in form and
likeness of a great dragon that is a hundred fathom of length, as
men say, for I have not seen her. And they of the isles call her
Lady of the Land. And she lieth in an old castle, in a cave, and
showeth twice or thrice in the year. And she doth none harm to no
man but if man do her harm. And she was thus changed and
transformed from a fair damsel in the likeness of a dragon by a
goddess that was clept Diana. And men say that she shall so endure
in the form of a dragon unto the time that a knight come that is so
hardy that dare come to her and kiss her on the mouth; and then
shall she turn again to her own kind, and be a woman again, but
after that she shall not live long.</p>

<p>And it is not long since that a knight that was hardy and
doughty in arms said that he would kiss her. And when he was upon
his courser and went to the castle and entered into the cave, the
dragon lifted up her head against him. And when the knight saw her
in that form so hideous and so horrible, he fled away. And the
dragon bore the knight upon a rock, and from that rock she cast him
into the sea; and so was lost both horse and man.</p>

<p>Egypt is a long country, but it is strait, that is to say
narrow, for they may not enlarge it toward the desert, for default
of water. And the country is set along upon the river of Nile; by
as much as that river may serve by floods or otherwise, that when
it floweth it may spread through the country, so is the country
large of length. For there it raineth not but little in that
country, and for that cause they have no water but if it be of the
flood of that river. And for as much as it raineth not in that
country, but the air is always pure and clear, therefore in that
country be they good astronomers, for they find there no clouds to
let them.</p>

<p>In Egypt is the city of Elyople, that is to say, the City of the
Sun. In that city there is a temple made round, after the shape of
the Temple of Jerusalem. The<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span> priests of that temple
have all their writings under the date of the fowl that is clept
Ph&oelig;nix; and there is none but one in all the world. And he
cometh to burn himself upon the altar of the temple at the end of
500 years; for so long he liveth. And at the 500 years' end the
priests array their altar honestly, and put thereupon spices and
sulphur and other things that will burn lightly. And then the bird
Ph&oelig;nix cometh, and burneth himself to ashes. And the first day
next after men find in the ashes a worm; and the second day after
men find a bird quick and perfect; and the third day next after, he
flieth away.</p>

<p>And so there is no more birds of that kind in all the world but
it alone. And truly that is a great miracle of God, and men may
well liken that bird unto God; because that there is no God but
one, and also that our Lord arose from death to life the third day.
This bird men see oftentime flying in the countries; and he is not
much greater than an eagle. And he hath a crest of feathers upon
his head more great than the peacock hath; and his neck is yellow;
and his back is coloured blue as Ind; and his wings be of purple
colour, and the tail is yellow and red. And he is a full fair bird
to look upon against the sun, for he shineth fully gloriously and
nobly.</p>

<p>From Egypt men may go by the Red Sea, and so by desert to the
Mount of Synay; and when they have visited the holy places nigh to
it, then will they turn toward Jerusalem. They shall see here the
Holy Sepulchre, where there is a full fair church, all round and
open above and covered with lead. And then they may go up to
Golgatha by degrees, and they shall see the Mount of Calvarie.
Likewise they will behold the Temple of our Lord; and many other
blessed things all whereof I cannot tell nor show him.</p>

<div class="center"><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span><i>II.&mdash;Of Strange Peoples and Strange
Beasts in Divers Lands</i></div>

<p>From the south coast of Chaldea is Ethiopia, a great country
that stretcheth to the end of Egypt. Ethiopia is departed in two
principal parts, and that is the East part and the Meridional part.
And the folk of that country are black, and more black than in the
other part, and they be clept Moors. In Ethiopia be folk that have
but one foot, and they go so fast that it is a marvel; and the foot
is so large, that it shadoweth all the body against the sun, when
they will lie and rest them. In that country when the children be
young and little they be all yellow, and when they wax of age that
yellowness turneth to be all black. And as men go forth towards
Ind, they come to the city of Polombe, and above the city is a
great mountain.</p>

<p>And at the foot of that mount is a fair well and a great, that
hath odour and savour of all spices, and at every hour of the day
he changeth his odour and his savour diversely. And whoso drinketh
three times fasting of that water of that well he is whole of all
manner of sickness that he hath. And they that dwell there and
drink often of that well they never have sickness, and they seem
always young. I have drunken of it, and yet, methinketh, I fare the
better. Some men call it the Well of Youth, for they that often
drink thereof seem always young and live without sickness. And men
say that that well cometh out of Paradise, and that therefore it
hath such virtue.</p>

<p>To that land go the merchants for spicery. And there men worship
the ox for his simpleness and for his meekness, and for the profit
that cometh of him. And they say that he is the holiest beast in
the earth. For it seemeth to them that whosoever is meek and
patient he is holy and profitable; for then they say he hath all
virtues<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">
215</a></span> in him. They make the ox to labour six years or
seven, and then they eat him. And the king of the country hath
always an ox with him; and he that keepeth him hath every day great
fees.</p>

<p>Now shall I tell you of countries and isles that lie beyond
those countries that I have spoken of. Wherefore I tell you that in
passing by the land of Cathay toward the higher Ind, men pass by a
kingdom that they call Caldilhe, that is a full fair country. And
there groweth a manner of fruit, as it were gourds; and when they
be ripe men cut them in two, and men find within a little beast, in
flesh, in bone and blood, as though it were a little lamb without
wool. And men eat both the fruit and the beast, and that is a great
marvel. Of that fruit I have eaten, although it were wonderful; but
that I know well that God is marvellous in His works. And
nevertheless, I told them of as great a marvel to them that is
among us; for I told them that in our country were trees that bear
a fruit that become birds flying, and those that fall into the
water live, and they that fall on the earth die anon; and they be
right good for man's meat. And thereof they also had great marvel,
that some of them trowed it were an impossible thing to be.</p>

<p>And beyond this land, men go towards the land of Bacharie, where
be full evil folk and full cruel.</p>

<p>In that land be trees that bear wool, as though it were of
sheep; whereof men make clothes, all things that may be made of
wool. And there be also many griffons, more plenty than in any
other country. Some men say that they have the body upward as an
eagle and beneath as a lion; and truly they say sooth that they be
of that shape. But one griffon hath the body more great and is more
strong than eight lions; of such lions as be of this half; and more
great and stronger than a hundred eagles such as we have amongst
us. For one griffon there will bear, flying to his nest, a great
horse, or two oxen yoked together, as they go at the plough. For
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">
216</a></span> hath his talons so long and so large and great upon
his feet, as though they were horns of great oxen or of bugles or
of kine; so that men make cups of them, to drink of. From thence go
men, by many journeys, through the land of Prester John, the great
Emperor of Ind.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Of the Land of Prester
John</i></div>

<p>The Emperor Prester John holdeth a full great land, and hath
many full noble cities and good towns in his realm, and many great
isles and large. And he hath under him seventy-two provinces, and
in every province is a king. And these kings have kings under them,
and all are tributaries to Prester John. And he hath in his
lordships many great marvels. For in his country is the sea that
men call the Gravelly Sea, that is all gravel and sand without any
drops of water; and it ebbeth and floweth in great waves, as other
seas do, and it is never still nor in peace. And no man may pass
that sea by navy, nor by no manner of craft, and therefore may no
man know what land is beyond that sea. And albeit that it have no
water, yet men find therein and on the banks full good fish of
other manner of kind and shape than men find in any other sea; and
they are of right good taste and delicious to man's meat.</p>

<p>In the same lordship of Prester John there is another marvellous
thing. There is a vale between two mountains, that dureth nigh on
four miles; and some call it the Vale of Devils, and some call it
the Valley Perilous. In that vale men hear often time great
tempests and thunders and great murmurs and noises all days and
nights; and great noise, as it were sown of tabors, and of
trumpets, as though it were of a great feast. This vale is all full
of devils, and hath been always. And men say there, that is one of
the entries of hell. And in mid place of that vale under a rock is
a head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">
217</a></span> and the visage of a devil bodily, full horrible and
dreadful to see, and it showeth not but the head to the
shoulders.</p>

<p>But there is no man in the world so hardy, Christian man nor
other, but that he would be in dread for to behold it and that he
would be ready to die for dread, so is it hideous for to behold.
For he beholdeth every man so sharply with dreadful eyes that be
evermore moving and sparkling as fire, and changeth and stareth so
often in diverse manner with so horrible countenance that no man
dare come nigh him. And in that vale is gold and silver and rich
jewels great plenty. And I and my fellows passed that way in great
dread, and we saw much people slain. And we entered fourteen
persons, but at our going out we were but nine. And so we wisten
never whether that our fellows were lost or turned again for
dread.</p>

<p>But we came through that vale whole and living for that we were
very devout, for I was more devout then than ever I was before or
after, and all for the dread of fiends, that I saw in diverse
figures. And I touched none of the gold and silver that meseemed
was there, lest it were only there of the subtlety of the devils,
and because I would not be put out of my devotions. So God of His
grace helped us, and so we passed that perilous vale, without peril
and without encumbrance, thanked be Almighty God.</p>

<p>These things have I told, that men may know some of all those
marvellous things that I have seen in my way by land and sea. And
now I, John Mandeville, Knight, that have passed many lands and
many isles and countries, and searched many full strange places,
and have been in many a full good honourable company, and at many a
fair deed of armes&mdash;albeit that I did none myself, for mine
unable insuffisance&mdash;now I am come home&mdash;mawgree
myself&mdash;to rest. And so I have written these things in this
book. Wherefore I pray to all the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span> readers and hearers of
this book that they would pray to God for me. And I shall pray for
them, and beseech Almighty God to full fill their souls with
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, in saving them from all their
enemies both of body and soul, to the worship and thanking of Him
that in perfect Trinity liveth and reigneth God, in all worlds and
in all times; Amen, Amen, Amen.</p>

<h4>MUNGO PARK</h4>

<h4>Travels in the Interior of Africa</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Up the Gambia</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Mungo Park, who was born Sept. 20, 1771, on a farm near Selkirk,
Scotland, and died in 1806 in Africa, will for ever be regarded as
the most distinguished pioneer of the illustrious procession of
African explorers. Trained as a surgeon at Edinburgh, in 1792 he
undertook an adventurous exploration in the East Indies. In 1795
the African Association appointed him successor to Major Houghton,
who had perished in seeking to trace the course of the Niger and to
penetrate to Timbuctoo. He disappeared in the interior for eighteen
months, and was given up for lost, but survived to tell the
romantic story of his experiences. Returning to Scotland, Mungo
Park married, but his passion for travel was irrepressible. In May,
1805, he set out on another expedition, with an imposing party of
over forty Europeans. The issue was disastrous. Park and his
companions were ambushed and slain by treacherous natives while
passing through a river gorge. His "Travels in the Interior of
Africa" was published in 1799, and has been frequently reprinted.
Told in simple, unaffected style, the general accuracy of the
narrative has never been questioned.</p>
</div>

<p>Soon after my return from the East Indies in 1793, having learnt
that noblemen and gentlemen associated for the purpose of
prosecuting discoveries in the interior of Africa were desirous of
engaging a person to explore that continent by way of the Gambia
River, I took occasion, through means of the president of the Royal
Society, to whom I had the honour of being known, of offering
myself for that service. I had a passionate desire to examine into
the productions of a country so little known. I knew I was able to
bear fatigue, and relied on my youth and strength of constitution
to preserve me from the effects of climate.</p>

<p>The committee accepted me for the service, and their <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">
220</a></span> kindness supplied me with all that was necessary. I
took my passage in the brig Endeavour, a small brig trading to the
Gambia for beeswax and honey, commanded by Captain Richard Wyatt.
My instructions were very plain and concise. I was directed, on my
arrival in Africa, to pass on to the River Niger, either by way of
Bambouk, or by such other route as should be found most convenient;
that I should ascertain the course, and, if possible, the rise and
termination of that river; that I should use my utmost exertions to
visit the principal towns or cities in its neighbourhood,
particularly Timbuctoo and Houssa.</p>

<p>We sailed from Portsmouth on May 22, 1795; on June 4 saw the
mountains over Mogadore on the coast of Africa; and on June 22
anchored at Jillifree, a town on the northern bank of the River
Gambia, opposite to James's Island, where the English formerly had
a small port. The kingdom of Barra, in which the town of Jillifree
is situated, produces great plenty of the necessaries of life; but
the chief trade is in salt, which they carry up the river in canoes
as high as Barraconda, and bring down in return Indian corn, cotton
cloths, elephants' teeth, small quantities of gold dust, etc.</p>

<p>On June 23 we proceeded to Vintain, two miles up a creek on the
southern side of the river, much resorted to by Europeans on
account of the great quantities of beeswax brought hither for sale.
The wax is collected in the woods by the Feloops, a wild and
unsociable race of people, who in their trade with Europeans
generally employ a factor or agent of the Mandingo nation. This
broker, who speaks a little English, and is acquainted with the
trade of the river, receives certain part only of the payment,
which he gives to his employer as a whole. The
remainder&mdash;which is very truly called the "cheating
money"&mdash;he receives when the Feloop is gone, and appropriates
to himself as a reward for his trouble.</p>

<p>On June 26 we left Vintain, and continued our course<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span> up
the deep and muddy river. The banks are covered with impenetrable
thickets of mangrove, and the whole of the adjacent country appears
to be flat and swampy. At the entrance of the Gambia from the sea
sharks abound, and higher up alligators and hippopotami. In six
days after leaving Vintain we reached Jonkakonda, a place of
considerable trade, where our vessel was to take in part of her
lading. Dr. Laidley, a gentleman who had resided many years at an
English factory on the Gambia, to whom I had a letter of
recommendation, came to invite me to his house, to remain there
till an opportunity should offer of prosecuting my journey. I set
out for Pisania, a small village in the dominions of the King of
Yany, and arrived there on July 5, and was accommodated in the
doctor's home.</p>

<p>On this occasion I was referred to certain traders called
slatees. These are free black merchants, of great consideration in
this region, who come down from the interior chiefly with enslaved
negroes for sale. But I soon found that very little dependence
could be placed on their descriptions. They contradicted each other
in the most important particulars, and all of them seemed most
unwilling that I should prosecute my journey.</p>

<p>The country is a uniform and monotonous level, but is of
marvellous fertility. Grain and rice are raised in great abundance,
besides which the inhabitants in the vicinity of the towns and
villages have gardens which produce onions, calavances, yams,
cassava, ground-nuts, pompions, gourds, watermelons, and other
esculent plants. I observed also near the towns small patches of
cotton and indigo.</p>

<p>The chief wild animals are the antelope, hy&aelig;na, panther,
and the elephant. When I told some of the inhabitants how the
natives of India tame and use the elephant, they laughed me to
scorn, and exclaimed, "Tobaubo fonnio!" (white man's lie). The
negroes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">
222</a></span> hunt the elephant chiefly for the sake of the
teeth. The flesh they eat, and consider it a great delicacy. The
ass is the usual beast of burden in all the negro territories.
Animal labour is nowhere applied to purposes of agriculture; the
plough, therefore, is wholly unknown.</p>

<p>As the Slatees and others composing the caravans seemed
unwilling to further my purpose, I resolved to avail myself of the
dry season and proceed without them. Dr. Laidley approved my
determination, and with his help I made preparations.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Penetrating the Wild
Interior</i></div>

<p>The kingdom of Kajaaga, in which I now commenced to travel, is
bounded on the south-east and south by Bambouk, on the west by
Bondou, and on the north by the River Senegal. The people, who are
jet black, are called Serawoollies. They are habitually a trading
tribe. Arriving in December at Joag, the frontier town, we took up
our residence at the house of the chief man, who is called the
dooty. My fellow-travellers were ten dealers, forming a little
caravan, bound for the Gambia. Their asses were loaded with ivory,
the large teeth being conveyed in nets, two on each side of the
ass; the small ones are wrapped up in skins and secured with
ropes.</p>

<p>Journeying by easy stages from place to place, I at length
arrived at the important town of Jarra, which is situated in the
Moorish kingdom of Ludamar. The greater part of the inhabitants are
negroes, who prefer a precarious protection from the Moors, which
they purchase by a tribute, rather than continued exposure to their
predatory hostilities. Of the origin of these Moorish tribes
nothing further seems to be known than that before the Arabian
conquest, about the middle of the seventh century, all the
inhabitants of Africa, whether they were descended from Numidians,
Ph&oelig;nicians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id=
"Page_223">223</a></span> Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals,
or Goths, were comprehended under the general name of <i>Mauri</i>,
or Moors. All these nations were converted to the religion of
Mahomet during the Arabian empire under the caliphs.</p>

<p>The Moors, who are widely spread over the African continent, are
a subtle and treacherous race. They take every opportunity of
cheating and plundering the credulous and unsuspecting negroes.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Jarra, I obtained a lodging at the house of
Daman Jumma, a Gambia slatee, who owed money to Dr. Laidley, from
whom I had an order on him for the money, to the amount of six
slaves. But he said he was afraid he could not in his present
situation pay more than the value of two slaves. However, he gave
me his aid in exchanging my beads and amber for gold, which was a
portable article, and more easily concealed from the Moors.</p>

<p>Difficulties speedily arose. The unsettled state of the country
from recent wars, and, above all, the overbearing deportment of the
Moors, so completely frightened my attendants that they declared
they would relinquish every claim to reward rather than proceed a
step farther eastward. Indeed the danger they incurred of being
seized by the Moors and sold into slavery became more apparent
every day. Thus I could not condemn their apprehensions.</p>

<p>In this situation, deserted by my attendants, with a Moorish
country of ten days' journey before me, I applied to Daman to
obtain permission from Ali, the chief or sovereign of Ludamar, that
I might pass unmolested through his territory, and I hired one of
Daman's slaves to accompany me as soon as the permit should arrive.
I sent Ali a present of five garments of cotton cloth, which I
purchased of Daman for one of my fowling-pieces. Fourteen days
elapsed, and then one of Ali's slaves arrived with directions, as
he pretended,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">
224</a></span> to conduct me in safety as far as Goomba. He
told me that I was for this service to pay him one garment of blue
cotton cloth. Things being adjusted, we set out from Jarra, and,
after a toilsome journey of three days, came to Deena, a large
town, where the Moors are in greater proportion to the negroes than
at Jarra. Assembling round the hut of the negro where I lodged, the
Moors treated me with the greatest insolence. They hissed, shouted,
and abused me; they even spat in my face, with a view to irritate
me and afford a pretext for seizing my baggage. Finding such
insults had not the desired effect, they had recourse to the final
argument that I was a Christian, and that, of course, my property
was lawful plunder to the followers of Mahomet.</p>

<p>Accordingly they opened my bundles and robbed me of everything
they fancied. My attendants refused to go farther, and I resolved
to proceed alone rather than to pause longer among these insolent
Moors. At two the next morning I departed from Deene. It was
moonlight, but the roaring of wild beasts made it necessary to
proceed with caution. Two negroes, altering their minds, followed
me and overtook me, in order to attend me. On the road we observed
immense quantities of locusts, the trees being quite black with
them.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III&mdash;Romantic Savage Life</i></div>

<p>Arriving at Dalli, we found a dance proceeding in front of the
dooty's house. It was a feast day. Informed that a white man was in
the place, the performers stopped their dance and came to the spot
where I was, walking in order, two by two, following the musician,
who played on a curious sort of flute. Then they danced and sang
till midnight, crowds surrounding me where I sat. The next day, our
landlord, proud of the honour of entertaining a white man, insisted
on my staying with him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id=
"Page_225">225</a></span> and his friends till the cool of the
evening, when he said he would conduct me to the next village. I
was now within two days of Goombia, had no apprehensions from the
Moors, accepted the invitation, and spent the forenoon very
pleasantly with these poor negroes. Their company was the more
acceptable as the gentleness of their manners presented a striking
contrast to the rudeness and barbarity of the Moors. They enlivened
their conversation by drinking a fermented liquor made from corn.
Better beer I never tasted in England.</p>

<p>In the midst of this harmless festivity I flattered myself that
all danger from the Moors was over, and fancy had already placed me
on the banks of the Niger, when a party of Moors entered the hut,
and dispelled the golden dream. They said that they came by Ali's
orders to convey me to his camp at Benown. If I went peaceably,
they told me, I had nothing to fear; but if I refused, they had
orders to bring me by force. I was struck dumb by surprise and
terror, which the Moors observing, repeated that I had nothing to
fear. They added that the visit was occasioned by the curiosity of
Ali's wife, Fatima, who had heard so much about Christians that she
was very anxious to see one. We reached Benown after a journey in
great heat of four days, during which I suffered much from thirst.
Ali's camp consisted of a great number of dirty-looking tents,
amongst which roamed large herds of camels, sheep, and goats.</p>

<p>My arrival was no sooner observed than the people who drew water
at the wells threw down their buckets, those in the tents mounted
their horses, and men, women, and children came running or
galloping towards me. At length we reached the king's tent. Ali was
an old Arab, with a long, white beard, of sullen and indignant
aspect. He surveyed me with attention, and seemed much surprised
when informed that I could not speak Arabic. He continued silent,
but the surrounding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id=
"Page_226">226</a></span> attendants, especially the
ladies, were abundantly inquisitive, and asked a thousand
questions. They searched my pockets, inspected every part of my
apparel, and even counted my fingers and toes, as if doubtful
whether I was in truth a human being.</p>

<p>I was submitted to much irritation and insult by the Moors in
the camp, and never did any period of my life pass away so heavily
as my sojourn there. The Moors are themselves very indolent, but
are rigid taskmasters over those who are under them.</p>

<p>Ali sent to inform me that there were many thieves in the
neighbourhood, and that to prevent my things from being stolen it
was necessary to convey them all to his tent. So my clothes,
instruments, and everything belonging to me were carried away. To
make sure of everything, he sent people the next morning to examine
whether I had anything concealed on my person. They stripped me
with the utmost rudeness of all my gold, amber, my watch, and
pocket-compass. The gold and amber were gratifying to Moorish
avarice, but the compass was an object of superstitious
curiosity.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Long Sought for
Niger</i></div>

<p>It is impossible to describe my joy when, after being three
months in captivity, I succeeded in effecting my escape. Arduous
days of travelling lay before me, and after many weeks of endurance
and fatigue, I saw with infinite pleasure the great object of my
mission&mdash;the long-sought-for, majestic Niger, glittering in
the morning sun, as broad as the Thames at Westminster, and flowing
slowly <i>to the eastward</i>. I hastened to the brink, drank of
the water, and lifted up my fervent thanks in prayer to the Great
Ruler of all things for having thus far crowned my endeavours with
success.</p>

<p>I waited more than two hours without having an opportunity of
crossing the river, during which time the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span> people who had
crossed carried information to Mansong, the king, that a white man
was waiting for a passage, and was coming to see him. He
immediately sent over one of his chief men, who informed me that
the king could not possibly see me till he knew what had brought me
to his country, and that I must not presume to cross the river
without the king's permission.</p>

<p>He therefore advised me to lodge at a distant village, to which
he pointed, for the night, and said that in the morning he would
give me further instructions how to conduct myself. This was very
discouraging. However, as there was no remedy, I set off for the
village, where I found, to my great mortification, that no person
would admit me into his house. I was regarded with astonishment and
fear, and was obliged to sit all day without victuals in the shade
of a tree.</p>

<p>The next day a messenger arrived from Mansong, with a bag in his
hand. He told me it was the king's pleasure that I should depart
forthwith from the district, but that Mansong, wishing to relieve a
white man in distress, had sent me 5,000 cowries, to enable me to
purchase provisions in the course of my journey. The messenger
added that, if my intentions were really to proceed to
Jenn&eacute;, he had orders to accompany me as a guide to
Sansanding. I was at first puzzled to account for this behaviour of
the king, but from the conversation I had with the guide, I had
afterwards reason to believe that Mansong would willingly have
admitted me to his presence at Sego, but was apprehensive he would
not be able to protect me against the blind and inveterate malice
of the Moorish inhabitants.</p>

<p>His conduct was, therefore, at once prudent and liberal. The
circumstances under which I made my appearance were undoubtedly
such as might create in the mind of the king a well-warranted
suspicion that I wished to conceal the true object of my
journey.</p>

<p>In the countries that I visited the population is not<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">
228</a></span> very great, considering the extent and fertility of
the soil and the ease with which the lands are obtained. I found
many extensive and beautiful districts entirely destitute of
inhabitants. Many places are unfavourable to population, from being
unhealthful. The swampy banks of the Gambia, the Senegal, and other
rivers towards the coast, are of this description. The negro
nations possess a wonderful similarity of disposition. The
Mandingoes, in particular, are a very gentle race; cheerful in
their disposition, inquisitive, incredulous, simple, and fond of
flattery. Perhaps the most prominent defect in their character is
the propensity to theft, which in their estimation is no crime. On
the other hand, it is impossible for me to forget the disinterested
charity and tender solicitude with which many of these poor
heathens, from the sovereign of Sego to the poor women who received
me at different times into their cottages when I was perishing of
hunger sympathised with me in my distresses, and contributed to my
safety.</p>

<p>On my return to Pisania, Dr. Laidley received me with great joy
and satisfaction, as one risen from the dead. No European vessel
had arrived at Gambia for many months previous to my return from
the interior. But on June 15 the ship Charlestown, an American
vessel, commanded by Mr. Charles Harris, entered the river. She
came for slaves, intending to touch at Goree to fill up, and to
proceed from thence to South Carolina. This afforded me an
opportunity of returning, though by a circuitous route, to my
native country. I therefore immediately engaged my passage in his
vessel for America. I disembarked at St. John's, and there took
passage to Antigua, where, catching the mail-packet for Falmouth, I
reached that port on December 22, having been absent from England
two years and seven months.</p>

<h4>MARCO POLO</h4>

<h4>Travels</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The Beginnings of a Romantic
Career</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Marco Polo stands out in history and literature as the most
famous traveller belonging to the early medi&aelig;val period. He
was born at Venice in 1254. In 1271, his father and uncle, Venetian
merchants, set out on a long and romantic Oriental journey, taking
with them young Marco, who now began the amazing career chronicled
in his book. Everywhere he made copious notes of his observations,
and his curious records, so astonishing as to meet with little
credence during the Middle Ages, have been so far confirmed as to
demonstrate his absolute fidelity to facts as he saw them, and to
such traditions as were communicated to him, however fantastic.
Returning to Venice in 1295, three years later he fought in his own
galley at Curzola, but on the defeat of the Venetians by the
Genoese he was taken captive and flung into a fortress at Genoa.
This captivity, which lasted a year, is memorable as being the
cause of bringing about the record of his extraordinary experiences
in the East. "The Travels of Marco Polo, a Venetian," consists
essentially of two parts&mdash;first, the author's personal
narrative; second, his description of the provinces and states and
the peoples of Asia during the latter half of the thirteenth
century.</p>
</div>

<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century, two merchants of
Venice, Nicolo and Maffeo Polo, voyaged with a rich cargo of
merchandise, in their own ship, to Constantinople, and thence to
the Black Sea. From the Crimea they travelled on horseback into
Western Tartary, where they resided in business for a year, gaining
by their politic behaviour the cordial friendship of the paramount
chief of the tribes, named Barka.</p>

<p>Prevented from returning to Europe through the outbreak of a
tribal war in Tartary, the travellers proceeded to Bokhara, where
they stayed three years. Here they made the acquaintance of the
ambassador of the famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230"
id="Page_230">230</a></span> Kublai Khan. This potentate is
called the "grand khan," or supreme prince of all the Tartar
tribes. The ambassador invited the merchants to visit his master.
Acceding to his request, they set out on the difficult journey, and
on reaching their destination were cordially received by Kublai,
for they were the first persons from Italy who had ever arrived in
his dominions. He begged them to take with them to their country a
commissioner from himself to the Pope of Rome. The result was
unfortunate, for the commissioner fell ill on the way through
Tartary in a few days, and was left behind. At Acre, the travellers
heard that Pope Clement IV. was dead. Arrived at Venice, Nicolo
Polo found that his wife had died soon after his departure in
giving birth to a son, the Marco of this history, who was now
fifteen years of age.</p>

<p>Waiting for two years in Venice, the election of a new pope
being delayed by successive obstacles, and fearing that the grand
khan would be disappointed or might despair of their return, they
set out again for the East, taking with them young Marco Polo. But
at Jerusalem they heard of the accession to the pontifical throne
of Gregory X., and hastened back to Italy. The new pope welcomed
them with great honour, furnished them with credentials, and
commissioned to accompany them to the East two friars of great
learning and talent, Fra Guglielmo da Tripoli and Fra Nicolo da
Vicenza. The party, entrusted with handsome presents from the
pontiff to the grand khan, voyaged forth, and reached Armenia to
find that region embroiled in war. The two friars, in terror,
returned to the coast under the care of certain knight templars;
but the three Venetians, accustomed to danger, continued their
journey, which, on account of slow winter progress, lasted
altogether three and a half years.</p>

<p>Kublai had removed to a splendid city named Cle Men Fu [near
where Peking now stands], and,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span> on arriving, a
gracious reception awaited the three merchants, who narrated events
and delivered the messages from Rome with the papal presents.
Taking special notice of young Marco, the grand khan enrolled him
among his attendants of honour. Marco soon became proficient in
four languages, and displayed such extraordinary talents that he
was sent on a mission to Karazan, a city six months' journey
distant. On this mission he distinguished himself by his tact and
success, and during the seventeen years spent in the service of the
khan executed many similar tasks in every part of the empire.</p>

<p>The Venetians remained many years at the Tartar court, and at
length, after amassing much wealth, felt constrained to return
home. They were permitted to depart, taking with them, at the
khan's request, a maiden named Kogatin, of seventeen, a relative of
the khan, whom they were to conduct to the court of Arghun, a
sovereign in India, to become his wife.</p>

<p>The travellers were not fortunate, for they were compelled,
through fresh wars among the Tartar princes, to return. But about
this time Marco Polo happened to arrive after a long voyage in the
East Indies, giving a most favourable report of the safety of the
seas he had navigated. Accordingly, it was arranged that the party
should go by sea; and fourteen ships were prepared, each having
four masts and nine sails, and some crews of over 200 men. On these
embarked the three Venetians, the Indian ambassadors, and the
queen. In three months Java was reached, and India in eighteen
more.</p>

<p>On landing, the travellers learned that the King of Arghun had
died some time before, and his son Kiakato was reigning in his
stead, and that the lady was to be presented to Kiasan, another
son, then on the borders of Persia guarding the frontier with an
army of 60,000. This was done, and then the party returned to the
residence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">
232</a></span> and there rested nine months before taking
their leave. While on their way they heard of the death of Kublai,
this intelligence putting an end to their plan of revisiting those
regions. Pursuing, therefore, their intended route, they at length
reached Trebizonde, whence they proceeded to Negropont, and finally
to Venice, at which place, in the enjoyment of health and abundant
riches, they safely arrived in the year 1295, and offered thanks to
God, Who had preserved them from innumerable perils.</p>

<p>The foregoing record enables the reader to judge of the
opportunities Marco Polo had of acquiring a knowledge of the things
he describes during a residence of many years in the eastern parts
of the world.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Legends of Ancient
Persia</i></div>

<p>Persia was anciently a great province, but it is now in great
part destroyed by the Tartars. From the city called Saba came the
three magi who adored Christ at Bethlehem. They are buried in Saba,
and are all three entire with their beards and hair. They were
Baldasar, Gaspar, and Melchior. After three days' journey you come
to Palasata, the castle of the fire-worshippers. The people say
that the three magi, when they adored Christ, were by Him presented
with a closed box, which they carried with them for several days,
and then, being curious to see what it contained, were constrained
to open. In it was a stone signifying that they should remain firm
to the faith they had received.</p>

<p>Thinking themselves deluded, they threw the stone into a pit,
whence instantly fire flamed forth. Bitterly repenting, they took
home with them some of the fire, and placed it in a church, where
it is adored as a god, the sacrifices all being performed before
it. Therefore, the people of Persia worship fire.</p>

<p>In the north of Persia the people tell of the Old Man<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">
233</a></span> of the Mountain. He was named Alo-eddin, and was a
Moslem. In a lovely valley he had planted a magnificent garden and
built a cluster of gorgeous palaces, supplied by means of conduits
with streams of wine, milk, honey, and pure water. Beautiful girls,
skilled in music and dancing, and richly dressed, were among the
inhabitants of this retreat.</p>

<p>The chief object of Alo-eddin in forming this fascinating garden
was to persuade his followers that, as Mahomet had promised to the
Moslems the enjoyments of Paradise, with every species of sensual
gratification, so he was also a prophet and the compeer of Mahomet,
and had the power of admitting to Paradise whom he pleased. An
impregnable castle guarded the entrance to the enchanting valley,
the entrance to this being through a secret passage.</p>

<p>At his court this chief entertained many youths, selected from
the people of the mountains for their apparent courage and martial
disposition. To these he daily preached on Paradise and his
prerogative of granting admission; and at certain times he caused
opium to be administered to a dozen of the youths, who, when half
dead with sleep, were conveyed to apartments in the palaces in the
gardens. On awakening, each person found himself surrounded by
lovely damsels, who sang, played, served delicate viands and
exquisite wines, till the youth, intoxicated with excess of
enjoyment, believed himself assuredly in Paradise, and felt
unwilling to quit it.</p>

<p>After four or five days the youths were again thrown into
somnolency and carried out of the garden; and when asked by
Alo-eddin where they had been, declared that by his favour they had
been in Paradise, the whole court listening with amazement to their
recital. The consequence was that his followers were so devoted to
his service that if any neighbouring chiefs or princes gave him
umbrage they were put to death by these disciplined<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">
234</a></span> assassins, and his tyranny made him dreaded
through all the surrounding provinces. He employed people to rob
travellers in their passage through his country. At length the
grand khan grew weary of hearing of his atrocious practices, and an
army was sent in the year 1262 to besiege him in his castle. It was
so strong that it held out for three years, until Alo-eddin was
forced through lack of provisions to surrender, and was put to
death. Thus perished the Old Man of the Mountain.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Of the Tartars and their Grand
Khan</i></div>

<p>Now that I have begun speaking of the Tartars, I will tell you
more about them. They never remain long anywhere, but when winter
approaches remove to the plains of a warmer region, in order to
find sufficient pasture for their cattle. Their flocks and herds
are multitudinous. Their tents are formed of rods covered with
felt, and being exactly round, and nicely put together, they can
gather them together into one bundle, and make them up as packages
to carry about. When they set them up again, they always make the
entrance front the south.</p>

<p>Their travelling-cars are drawn by oxen and camels. The women do
all the business of trading, buying, and selling, and provide
everything necessary for their husbands and families, the time of
the men being entirely devoted to hunting, hawking, and matters
that relate to military life. They have the best falcons and also
the best dogs in the world. They subsist entirely on flesh and
milk, consuming horses, camels, dogs, and animals of every
description. They drink mares' milk, preparing it so that it has
the qualities and flavour of white wine, and this beverage they
call kemurs.</p>

<p>The Tartars believe in a supreme deity, to whom they offer
incense and prayers; while they also worship<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
another, called Natigay, whose image, covered with felt, is kept in
every house. This god, who has a wife and children, and who, they
consider, presides over their terrestrial concerns, protects their
children, and guards their cattle and grain. They show him great
respect, and at their meals they never omit to take a fat morsel of
the flesh, and with it to grease the mouth of the idol.</p>

<p>Rich Tartars dress in cloth of gold and silks, with skins of the
sable, the ermine, and other animals. All their accoutrements are
of the most expensive kind. They are specially skilful in the use
of the bow, and they are very brave in battle, but are cruel in
disposition. Their martial qualities and their wonderful powers of
endurance make them fitted to subdue the world, as, in fact, they
have done with regard to a considerable portion of it.</p>

<p>When these Tartars engage in battle they never mingle with the
enemy, but keep hovering about him, discharging their arrows first
from one side, and then from the other, occasionally pretending to
fly, and during their flight shooting arrows backwards at their
pursuers, killing men and horses as if they were combating face to
face. In this sort of warfare the adversary imagines he has gained
a victory, when in fact he has lost the battle. For the Tartars,
observing the mischief they have done him, wheel about, and
renewing the fight, overpower his remaining troops, and make them
prisoners in spite of their utmost exertions.</p>

<p>Kublai is the sixth grand khan, and began his reign as grand
khan in the year 1246, and commenced his reign as Emperor of China
in 1280. It is forty-two years since he began his reign in Tartary
to the present year, 1288, and he is fully eighty-five years of
age. It was his ancestor, Jengiz, who assumed the title of khan.
Kublai is considered the most able and successful commander that
ever led the Tartars to battle. He it was who completed the
conquest of China by subduing the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span> southern provinces and
destroying the ancient dynasty. After this period he ceased to take
the field in person. His last campaign was against rebels, of whom
there were many both in Cathay and Manji [North and South
China].</p>

<p>The Tartars date the beginning of their year from the beginning
of February, and it is their custom on that occasion to dress in
white. Great numbers of beautiful white horses are presented to the
grand khan. On the day of the White Feast all his elephants,
amounting to five thousand, are exhibited in procession, covered
with rich housings. It is a time of splendid ceremonials, and of
most sumptuous feasting. During the amusements a lion is conducted
into the presence of his majesty, so tame that it is taught to lay
itself down at his feet.</p>

<p>The grand khan has many leopards and lynxes kept for the purpose
of chasing deer, and also many lions, which are larger than the
Babylonian lions, and are active in seizing boars, wild oxen, and
asses, stags, roebucks, and of other animals that are objects of
sport. It is an admirable sight, when the lion is let loose in
pursuit of the animal, to observe the savage eagerness and speed
with which he overtakes it. His majesty has them conveyed for this
purpose in cages placed on cars, and along with them is confined a
little dog, with which they become familiarised. The grand khan has
eagles also, which are trained to stoop at wolves, and such is
their size and strength that none, however large, can escape from
their talons.</p>

<p>Before we proceed further we shall speak of a memorable battle
that was fought in the kingdom of Yun-chang. When the king of Mien
[Burma] heard that an army of Tartars had arrived at Yun-chang, he
resolved to attack it, in order that by its destruction the grand
khan might be deterred from again attempting to station a force on
the borders of his dominions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>For this purpose he assembled a very large army, including a
multitude of elephants (an animal with which the country abounds),
on whose backs were placed battlements, or castles of wood, capable
of containing to the number of twelve or sixteen in each. With
these, and a numerous army of horse and foot, he took the road to
Yun-chang, where the grand khan's army lay, and encamping at no
great distance from it, intended to give his troops a few days of
rest.</p>

<p>The Tartars, chiefly by their wonderful skill in archery,
inflicted a terrible defeat on their foes; and the King of Mien,
though he fought with the most undaunted courage, was compelled to
flee, leaving the greater part of his troops killed or wounded.</p>

<p>In the northern parts of the world there dwell many Tartars,
under a chief of the name of Kaidu, nearly related to Kublai, the
grand khan. These Tartars are idolaters. They possess vast herds of
horses, cows, sheep, and other domestic animals. In these northern
districts are found prodigious white bears, black foxes, wild asses
in great numbers, and swarms of sables and martens. During the long
and severe winters the Tartars travel in sledges drawn by great
dogs.</p>

<p>Beyond the country of these northern Tartars is another region,
which extends to the utmost bounds of the north, and is called the
Region of Darkness, because during most part of the winter months
the sun is invisible, and the atmosphere is obscured to the same
degree as that in which we find it just about the dawn of day, when
we may be said to see and not to see. The intellects of the people
are dull, and they have an air of stupidity. The Tartars often
proceed on plundering expeditions against them, to rob them of
their cattle and goods, availing themselves for this purpose of
those months in which the darkness prevails.</p>

<div class="center"><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span><i>IV.&mdash;Of Ceylon and Malabar</i></div>

<p>The island of Zeilan [Ceylon] is better circumstanced than any
other in the world. It is governed by a king named Sendernaz. The
people worship idols, and are independent of every other state.
Both men and women go nearly nude. Their food is milk, rice, and
flesh, and they drink wine drawn from trees. Here is the best
sappan-wood that can anywhere be met with.</p>

<p>The island produces more beautiful and valuable rubies than can
be found in any other part of the world, and also many other
precious stones. The king is reported to possess the grandest ruby
that ever was seen, being a span in length, and the thickness of a
man's arm, brilliant beyond description, and without a single flaw.
The grand khan, Kublai, sent ambassadors to this monarch, with a
request that he would yield to him possession of this ruby; in
return for which he should receive the value of a city. The answer
was that he would not sell it for all the treasure of the universe.
The grand khan, therefore, failed to acquire it.</p>

<p>Leaving the island of Zeilan, you reach the great province of
Malabar, which is part of the continent of the greater India, the
noblest and richest country in the world. It is governed by four
kings, of whom the principal is named Sender-bandi. Within his
district is a fishery for pearls. The pearl oysters are brought up
in bags by divers. The king wears many jewels of immense value, and
among them is a fine silken string containing one hundred and four
splendid pearls and rubies. He has at least a thousand wives and
concubines, and when he sees a woman whose beauty pleases him, he
immediately signifies his desire to possess her. The heat of the
country is excessive, and on that account the people go naked.</p>

<p>In this kingdom, and also throughout India, all the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
beasts and birds are unlike those of our own country. There are
bats as large as vultures, and vultures as black as crows, and much
larger than ours.</p>

<p>In the province of Malabar is the body of St. Thomas the
Apostle, who there suffered martyrdom. It rests in a small city to
which vast numbers of Christians and Saracens resort. The latter
regard him as a great prophet, and name him Ananias, signifying a
holy personage.</p>

<p>In the year 1288 a powerful prince of the country, who at the
time of harvest had accumulated as his portion an enormous quantity
of rice, and whose granaries could not hold the vast store, used
for that purpose a religious house belonging to the church of St.
Thomas, although the guardians of the shrine begged him not thus to
occupy the place. He persisted, and on the next night the holy
apostle appeared to him, holding a small lance in his hand, which
he held at his throat, threatening him with a miserable death if he
should not immediately evacuate the house. The prince awoke in
terror, and obeyed.</p>

<p>Various miracles are daily wrought here through the
interposition of the blessed saint. The Christians who have the
care of the church possess groves of cocoanut-trees, and from these
derive the means of subsistence. The death of this most holy
apostle took place thus. Having retired to a hermitage, where he
was engaged in prayer, and being surrounded by a number of
peafowls, with which bird the country abounds, an idolater who
happened to be passing, and did not perceive the holy man, shot an
arrow at a peacock, which struck St. Thomas in the side. He only
had time to thank the Lord for all His mercies, and into His hands
resigned his spirit.</p>

<p>In the kingdom of Musphili [Solconda], which you enter upon
leaving Malabar after proceeding five hundred miles northward, are
the best and most honourable<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span> merchants that can be
found. No consideration whatever can induce them to speak an
untruth. They have also an abhorrence of robbery, and are likewise
remarkable for the virtue of continence, being satisfied with the
possession of one wife. The Brahmins are distinguished by a certain
badge, consisting of a thick cotton thread passed over the shoulder
and tied under the arm.</p>

<p>The people are gross idolaters, and much addicted to sorcery and
divination. When they are about to make a purchase of goods, they
observe the shadow cast by their own bodies in the sunshine, and if
the shadow be as large as it should be, they make the purchase that
day. Moreover, when they are in a shop for the purchase of
anything, if they see a tarantula, of which there are many there,
they take notice from which side it comes, and regulate their
business accordingly. Again, if they are going out of their houses
and they hear anyone sneeze they return to the house and stay at
home.</p>

<h4>BERNARDIN DE SAINT PIERRE</h4>

<h4>Voyage to the Isle of France</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Miseries of Slavery</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In 1768 Bernardin de Saint Pierre (see <span class=
"smcap">Fiction</span>) was sent out to Mauritius, which was then a
French colony called the Isle of France, to fortify it against the
English. He found it was not worth fortifying, and, after an
absence of three years, he returned to France, and in 1773
published his famous "Voyage to the Isle of France," and thereby
made his name. It gave him a position similar to that which Defoe
occupies in England, for by means of it he introduced into French
literature the exotic element which he afterwards expanded in "Paul
and Virginia." He was the first French writer of genius to apply
the art of description in depicting the life and scenery of
far-distant lands. Finally, it is interesting to remark on the
general change which has taken place in the treatment of subject
native races since the time when Saint Pierre wrote, even though
such atrocities as came to light in the recent Congo scandal may be
still burning themselves out in isolated instances.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Port Louis</span>, <i>August 6, 1768</i>.
The Isle of France was discovered by a Portuguese, and taken over
by the Dutch; but they abandoned it in 1712, and settled at the
Cape of Good Hope, and the French then took possession of it.</p>

<p>The island was a desert when we took it over, and the first
settlers were a few honest, simple farmers from our colony of
Bourbon, who lived together very happily until 1760, when the
English drove us out of India. Then, like a flood, all the
scoundrels, rogues and broken men hunted from our Indian
possessions, invaded the island and threw everything into disorder
and ruin. Everybody is envious and discontented; everybody wishes
to make a fortune at once and depart. And this is an island with no
commerce and scarcely any agriculture, where the only money found
is paper money! Yet they all say they will<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span> be rich enough to
return to France in a year's time. They have been saying this for
many years. Everything is in a state of squalid neglect. The
streets are neither paved nor planted with trees; the houses are
merely tents of wood, moved from place to place on rollers; the
windows have no glass and no curtains, and it is rare that one
finds within even a few poor pieces of furniture.</p>

<p>There are only four hundred farmers. The rest of the white
population are mainly idlers, who gather together in the square
from noon till evening and pass away the time in gambling and
scandalmongering. The work of agriculture is carried on by black
slaves imported from Madagascar. They can be got in exchange for a
gun or a roll of cloth, and the dearest does not cost more than
seven pounds. They are compelled to work from sunrise to sunset,
and they are given nothing to eat but mashed maize boiled in water,
and tapioca bread. At the least negligence the skin is scourged
from their body. The women are punished in the same manner.
Sometimes when they are old they are left to starve to death. Every
day during my sojourn in the Isle of France I have seen black men
and black women lashed hands and feet to a ladder and flogged for
having forgot to shut a door or for breaking a bit of pottery. I
have seen them bleeding all over, and having their wounded bodies
rubbed with vinegar and salt. I have seen them speechless with
excess of pain; I have seen some of them bite the iron cannon on
which they have been bound.</p>

<p>I do not know if coffee and sugar are necessary to the happiness
of Europe, but I know well that these two vegetables are a source
of misery to the inhabitants of two continents of the world. We are
dispeopling America in order to have a land to grow them; we are
dispeopling Africa in order to have a nation to cultivate them.
There are 20,000 black slaves on the Isle of France, but they die
so fast that, in order to keep up<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span> their number, 1,200
more have to be imported every year.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that our philosophers who attack abuses with so
much courage have hardly spoken of the slavery of the black races,
except to make a jest of it. They have eyes only for things very
remote. They speak of St. Bartholomew, of the massacre of the
Mexicans by the Spaniards, as if this crime was not one committed
now by the half of Europe. Oh, ye men who dream of republics, see
how your own people misuse the authority entrusted to them! See
your colonies streaming with human blood! The men who shed it are
men of your stamp; they talk like you, they talk of humanity, they
read the books of our philosophers, and they exclaim against
despotism; but when they get any power they show that they are
really brutes. In a country of so corrupt a morality an absolute
government is necessary. The excesses of a single tyrant are
preferable to the crimes and the injustices of a whole people.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;A Land of Beauty and
Abominations</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Port Louis</span>, <i>September 13,
1769</i>. An officer proposed to make a walking tour round the
island with me, but when the time came to set out he excused
himself, so I resolved to go alone. But knowing that I should often
have to camp out in the woods alone, I took two negroes with me to
carry provisions, and I armed myself with a double-barrel gun and a
couple of pistols, for fear I should encounter one of the bands of
runaway slaves that hide in the deserted part of the island.</p>

<p>Striking out through the plains of Saint Pierre, we walked for
four days along the seashore, with the dense and silent forest on
our left hand. On crossing the black river I came to the last farm
on this part of the coast. It was a long hut, formed of stakes and
covered with palm leaves. There was only one room. In the
middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">
244</a></span> of it was the kitchen; at one extremity were the
stores and the sleeping places of the eight black slaves; the other
end was the farmer's bed; a hen was setting on some eggs on the
counterpane, and some ducks were living beneath the bed, and around
the leafy wall pigeons had made their nests. In this miserable hut
I was surprised to find a very beautiful woman. She was a young
Frenchwoman, born, like her husband, of a good family. They had
come to the island some years ago in the hope of making a fortune;
they had left their parents, their friends, and their native land,
to pass their lives in this wild and lonely place, from which one
could see only the empty sea and the grim precipices of a desolate
mountain. But the air of contentment and goodness of this young and
lovely mother of a growing family seemed to make everybody around
her happy. When evening came she invited me to share a simple, but
neatly-served supper. The meal appeared to me an exceedingly
pleasant one. I was given as a bed-room a little tent built of
wood, about a hundred steps away from the log cabin. As the door
had not been put up, I closed the opening with planks, and loaded
my gun and pistols; for the forest all around is full of runaway
slaves. A few years ago forty of them began to make a plantation on
the mountain close by; the white settlers surrounded them and
called on them to surrender, but rather than return to captivity
all the slaves threw themselves into the sea.</p>

<p>I stayed with the farmer and his wife until three o'clock the
next morning. The farmer walked with me as far as Coral Point. He
was a remarkably robust man, and his face and arms and legs were
burnt by the sun. Unlike the ordinary settler, he worked himself in
tilling the land and felling and carting trees. The only thing that
worried him, he said to me, was the unnecessary trouble that his
wife took in bringing up her family. Not content with looking after
her own five children, she had recently burdened herself with the
care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">
245</a></span> of a little orphan girl. The honest farmer merely
told me of his little worries, for he saw clearly that I was aware
of all his happiness. When we took farewell of each other, we did
so with a cordial embrace.</p>

<p>The country beyond his farm was charming in its verdure and
freshness; it is a rich prairie stretching between the splendid sea
and the magnificent forest. The murmur of the fountains, the
beautiful colour of the waves, the soft movement of the scented air
filled me with joy and peace. I was sorry that I was alone; I
formed all kinds of plans. From all the outside world I only wanted
a few loved objects to enable me to pass my life in this paradise.
And great was my regret when I turned away from this beautiful yet
deserted place. I had scarcely gone 200 feet when a band of blacks,
armed with guns, came towards me. Advancing to them, I saw that
they were a detachment of the black police. One of them carried two
little dogs; another pulled a negress along by means of a cord
around her neck&mdash;she was part of the loot they had got in
attacking and dispersing a camp of runaway slaves. The negress was
broken with grief. I questioned her; she did not reply. On her back
she carried a large gaping bag. I look in it. Alas! it contained a
man's head. The natural beauty of the country disappeared. I saw it
as it really was&mdash;a land of abominations.</p>

<p>The Isle of France is regarded as a fortress which protects our
Indian possessions. It is as though Bordeaux were regarded as the
citadel of our American colonies. There are 1,500 leagues between
the Isle of France and Pondichery. Had we but spent on a fortress
on the Malabar coast or the mouth of the Ganges half of the money
which has been wasted on the Isle of France the English would not
now be masters of Bengal. What, then, is the use of the Isle of
France? To grow coffee and serve as a port of call.</p>

<div class="center"><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span><i>III.&mdash;Bourbon, the Pirates'
Island</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Port Louis</span>, <i>December 21, 1770</i>.
Having obtained permission to return to France, I embarked on
November 9, 1770, on the Indien. It took us twelve days to cover
the forty leagues between the Isle of France and Bourbon. This was
due to the calm weather; but on landing at Bourbon, we encountered
a hurricane.</p>

<p>Out of the calm sea there suddenly came a monstrous wave which
broke so violently on the shore that everybody fled. The foam rose
fifty feet into the air. Behind it came three waves the same height
and force, like three long rolling hills. The air was heavy, the
sky dark with motionless clouds, and the vast flocks of whimbrels
and drivers came in from the open sea and scattered along the
coast. The land birds and animals seemed perturbed. Even men felt a
secret terror at the sight of a frightful tempest in the midst of
calm weather.</p>

<p>On the second day the wind completely dropped, and the sea grew
wilder. The billows were more numerous, and swept in from the ocean
with great force. All the small boats were drawn far up on the
land, and the people strengthened their house with joists and
ropes. Seven ships besides the Indien were riding at anchor, and
the islanders gathered in a crowd along the shore to see if they
would weather the storm. At noon the sky began to lower, and a
strong wind arose suddenly from the south-east. Everyone was afraid
that the vessels would be flung ashore, and a signal was made from
the battery for them to depart. As the cannon went off, the vessels
cut their cables and got under sail, and at the end of two hours
they disappeared in the north-east in the midst of a black sky.</p>

<p>At three o'clock the hurricane came. The sound was frightful.
All the winds of heaven were loose. The stricken sea came over the
land in clouds of spindrift,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span> sand, and pebbles, and
buried everything within fifty feet of the shore in shingle. The
church was unroofed, and part of the Government House destroyed.
The hurricane lasted till three o'clock in the morning. The Indien
did not return, but sailed away with all my effects on it. There
was nothing for me to do but to wait at Bourbon for another,
homeward-bound ship; so I resolved to profit by my misfortune, and
make an excursion into the island.</p>

<p>This enabled me to gather something of the history of Bourbon.
It was first inhabited by a band of pirates, who brought with them
some negresses from Madagascar. This happened in 1657. Some time
afterwards our Indian company set up a factory in the island, and
the governor managed to keep on good terms with his dangerous
neighbours. One day the Portuguese viceroy of Goa anchored off the
island and came to dine with the governor. He had scarcely landed
when a pirate ship of fifty guns entered the harbour and captured
the Portuguese vessel. The captain of the pirates then landed, and
was also invited to dinner by the governor. The buccaneer sat down
at table by the side of the viceroy, and told the Portuguese that
he was now a prisoner. When the wine and the good cheer had put the
man in a good humour, M. Desforges (that was the name of our
governor) asked him at how much he fixed the ransom of the
viceroy.</p>

<p>"I want a thousand piastres," said the pirate.</p>

<p>"That's too little," replied M. Desforges, "for a brave man like
you and a great lord like him. Ask more than that, or ask
nothing."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the generous corsair, "he can go free."</p>

<p>The viceroy at once re-embarked and got under sail, Vastly
content at having escaped so cheaply.</p>

<p>The pirate afterwards settled in the island with all his
followers, and was hanged after an amnesty had been<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
published in favour of himself and his men. He had forgotten to
have his name included in it, and a counsellor who wished to
appropriate his spoils profited by the mistake, and had him put to
death. The second rogue, however, quickly came to almost as unhappy
an end. One of the pirates, who lived to the age of one hundred and
four years, died only a little time ago. His companions soon grew
more peaceful in their manners on adopting more peaceful
occupations, and, though their descendants are still distinguished
by a certain spirit of independence and liberty, this is now being
softened by the society of a multitude of worthy farmers who have
settled at Bourbon.</p>

<p>There are five thousand Europeans on the island and sixty
thousand blacks. The land is three times more peopled than that of
the Isle of France, and it is very much better cultivated.</p>

<p>The manners of the old settlers of Bourbon were very simple.
Most of the houses were never shut, and a lock was an object of
curiosity. The people kept their savings in a shell above their
door. They went barefooted, and fed on rice and coffee; they
imported scarcely anything from Europe, being content to live
without luxury provided they lived without trouble. When a stranger
landed on the island, they came without knowing him and offered him
their houses to live in.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Visit to the Cape Colony</i></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Port Louis</span>, <i>January 20, 1771</i>.
I have landed among the Dutch at the extremity of Africa without
money, without linen, and without friends. Learning of my position,
M. De Tolback, the governor of Cape Colony, has invited me to
dinner; and, happily, the secretary of the council has provided me
with money, having allowed me to use his credit in buying whatever
I need. The streets of the Cape are well set out; some are watered
by canals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id=
"Page_249">249</a></span> and most of them are planted with
oak trees. The fronts of the houses are shadowed by their foliage;
every door has seats on both sides in brick or turf, on which sit
fresh and rosy-faced women. There is no gambling at the Cape, no
play-acting or novel reading. The people are content with the
domestic happiness that virtue brings in its train. Every day
brings the same duties and pleasures. There are no spectacles at
the Cape and no one wants any; every man there has in his own home
all that he desires. Happy servants, well-bred children, good
wives: these are pleasures that fiction does not give.</p>

<p>A quiet life of this sort furnishes little matter for
conversation, so the Dutchmen of the Cape do not talk very much.
They are a rather melancholic people, and they prefer to feel
rather than to argue. So little happens, perhaps, that they have
nothing to talk about; but what does it matter if the mind is empty
when the heart is full, and when the tender emotions of nature can
move it without being excited by artifice or constrained by a false
decorum? When the girls of the Cape fall in love, they artlessly
avow their feelings, but they insist on choosing their own
husbands. The lads show the same frankness. The good faith which
the young persons of each sex keep towards each other generally
results in a happy marriage. Love with them is combined with
esteem, and this nourishes all during life in their constant souls
that desire to please which married persons in some other countries
only show outside their own home.</p>

<p>It was with much regret that I left these worthy people, but I
am not sorry to return to France. I prefer my own country to all
others, not because it is more beautiful, but because I was born
and bred there. Happy is the man who sees again the field in which
he learnt to walk and the orchard which he used to play in! Happier
still is he who has never quitted the paternal roof! How many
voyagers return and yet find no place of retreat. Of their friends,
some are dead, others are gone away;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span> but life is only a
brief voyage, and the age of man a rapid day. I wish to forget the
storms of it, and remember only in these letters the goodness, the
virtue, and the constancy that I have met with. Perhaps this humble
work may make your names, O virtuous settlers at the Cape, survive
when I am in the grave! For thee, O ill-fated negro! that weepest
on the rocks of the Isle of France, if my hand, which cannot wipe
away thy tears, can but bring the tyrants to weep in sorrow and
repentance, I shall want nothing more from the Indies; I shall have
gained there the only fortune I require.</p>

<h4>JOHN HANNING SPEKE</h4>

<h4>Discovery of the Source of the Nile</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Beginnings in the Black Man's
Land</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>John Hanning Speke was born on May 14, 1827, near Ilchester,
Suffolk, England. He entered the army in 1844, serving in India,
but his love of exploration and sport led him to visit the
Himalayas and Thibet; leaving India in 1854, he joined Sir Richard
Burton on his Somali expedition, where he was wounded and invalided
home. After the Crimean War he rejoined Burton in African
exploration, pushing forward alone to discover the Victoria
N'yanza, which he believed to be the source of the Nile. Speke's
work was so much appreciated by the Royal Geographical Society that
they sent him out again to verify this, his friend, Captain Grant,
accompanying him, and the exciting incidents of this journey are
set forth in his "Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the
Nile," which he published on his return in 1863. Honours were
bestowed on him for having "solved the problem of the ages," though
Burton sharply contested his conclusions. An accident while
partridge shooting on September 18, 1864, suddenly ended the career
of one who had proved himself to be a brave explorer, a good
sportsman, and an able botanist and geologist. His "Journal" is an
entrancing record of one of the greatest expeditions of modern
times, and is told with no small amount of literary skill. The work
was followed a year later by "What Led to the Discovery of the
Source of the Nile," these two forming, with the exception of a
number of magazine articles, Speke's entire literary output.</p>
</div>

<p>I started on my third expedition in Africa to prove that the
Victoria N'yanza was the source of the Nile, on May 9, 1859, under
the direction of the Royal Geographical Society, and Captain Grant,
an old friend and brother sportsman in India, asked to accompany
me. After touching at the Cape and East London we made our first
acquaintance with the Zulu Kaffirs at Delagoa Bay, and on August 15
we reached our destination, Zanzibar. Here I engaged my men, paying
a year's wages in advance, and anyone who saw the grateful avidity
with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">
252</a></span> which they took the money and pledged themselves to
serve me faithfully would think I had a first rate set of
followers.</p>

<p>At last we made a start, and reaching Uzaramo, my first
occupation was to map the country by timing the rate of march with
a watch, taking compass bearings, and ascertaining by boiling a
thermometer the altitude above the sea level, and the latitude by
the meridian of a star, taken with a sextant, comparing the lunar
distances with the nautical almanac. After long marching I made a
halt to send back some specimens, my camera, and a few of the
sickliest of my men, and then entered Usagara, which includes all
the country between Kingani and Mg&eacute;ta rivers east and Ugogo
the first plateau west&mdash;a distance of one hundred miles. Here
water is obtainable throughout the year, and where slave hunts do
not disturb the industry of the people, cultivation thrives, but
these troubles constantly occur, and the meagre looking wretches,
spiritless and shy, retreat to the hill tops at the sight of a
stranger.</p>

<p>At this point Baraka, the head of my Wanguana (emancipated
slaves) became discontented; ambition was fast making a fiend of
him, and I promoted Frij in his place. Shortly afterwards my
Hottentots suffered much from sickness, and Captain Grant was
seized with fever. In addition to these difficulties we found that
avarice, that fatal enemy to the negro chiefs, made them overreach
themselves by exhorbitant demands for taxes, for experience will
not teach the negro who thinks only for the moment. The curse of
Noah sticks to these his grandchildren by Ham, they require a
government like ours in India, and without it the slave trade will
wipe them off the face of the earth. We travelled slowly with our
sick Hottentot lashed to a donkey; the man died when we halted, and
we buried him with Christian honours. As his comrades said, he died
because he had determined to die&mdash;an instance of that
obstinate fatalism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id=
"Page_253">253</a></span> in their mulish temperament which no
kind words or threats can cure.</p>

<p>After crossing the hilly Usagara range, leaving the great famine
lands behind, we camped, on November 24, in the Ugogo country,
which has a wild aspect well in keeping with the natives who occupy
it, and who carry arms intended for use rather than show. They live
in flat-topped square villages, are fond of ornaments, impulsive by
nature, and avaricious. They pester travellers, jeering, quizzing,
and pointing at them on the road and in camp intrusively forcing
their way into the tents.</p>

<p>In January, after many very trying experiences, we arrived at
Unyamu&eacute;zi&mdash;the Country of the Moon&mdash;with which the
Hindus, before the Christian era, had commercial dealings in ivory
and slaves. The natives are wanting in pluck and gallantry, the
whole tribe are desperate smokers and greatly given to drink. Here
some Arabs came to pay their respects, they told me what I had said
about the N'yanza being the source of the Nile would turn out all
right, as all the people in the north knew that when the N'yanza
rose, the stream rushed with such violence it tore up islands and
floated them away. By the end of March we had crossed the forests,
forded the Quand&eacute; nullah and entered the rich flat district
of Mininga, where the gingerbread palm grows abundantly.</p>

<p>During my stay with Musa, the king at Kaz&eacute;, who had shown
himself friendly on a previous expedition, I underwent some trying
experiences in trying to mediate between two rival rulers, Snay and
Manua S&eacute;ra, between whom there was continual wrangle and
conflict. On one occasion Musa, who was suffering from a sharp
illness, to prove to me that he was bent on leaving Kaz&eacute; the
same time as myself, began eating what he called his training
pills&mdash;small dried buds of roses with alternate bits of sugar
candy. Ten of these buds, he said, eaten dry, were sufficient,
especially after having been boiled in rice water or milk.</p>

<p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">
254</a></span>Struggling on, faced by the thievish sultans and followed by my
train of quarrelling servants, I at last reached Uzinza, which is
ruled by a Wahuma chief of Abyssinian stock, and here I found the
petty chiefs quite as extortionate in extorting hongo (tax) as
others. To add to my troubles a new leader I had previously
engaged, called "the Pig," gave me great annoyance, causing a
mutiny amongst my men. Some were saying, "They were the flesh and I
was the knife; I cut and did with them just what I liked, and they
couldn't stand it any longer." However, they had to stand it, and I
brought them to reason.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Travel Difficulties and a King's
Hospitality</i></div>

<p>A bad cough began to trouble me so much that whilst mounting a
hill I blew and grunted like a broken-winded horse, and during an
enforced halt at Lum&eacute;r&eacute;si's village I was in constant
pain, so much that lying down became impossible. This chief tried
to plunder and detain me, and Baraka, my principal man, began to
grow discontented, because in my intention to push on to
Karagu&eacute; I was acting against impossibilities.
"Impossibilities!" I said. "What is impossible? Could I not go on
as a servant with the first caravan, or buy up a whole caravan if I
liked? What is impossible? For God's sake don't try any more to
frighten my men, for you have nearly killed me already in doing
so." My troubles did not end here. A letter came in from Grant,
whom I had left behind through sickness, that his caravan had been
attacked and wrecked and he was, as Baraka had heard, in sore
straits. However, to my inexpressible joy, a short time afterwards
Grant appeared and we had a good laugh over our misfortunes.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Usui I was told that Suwarora, its great king,
desired to give me an audience, and after days of more impudent
thieving on the part of his officers,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span> my man Bombay
came with exciting news. I questioned him.</p>

<p>"Will the big king see us?"</p>

<p>"Oh no. By the very best good fortune in the world, on going
into the palace, I saw Suwarora, and spoke to him at once, but he
was so tremendously drunk he could not understand."</p>

<p>"Well, what was Suwarora like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is a very fine man, just as tall and in the face very
like Grant, in fact, if Grant were black you would not know the
difference."</p>

<p>"Were his officers drunk too? And did you get drunk?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Bombay, grinning and showing his whole row of sharp,
pointed teeth.</p>

<p>November 16 found us rattling on again, as merry as larks, over
the red sandstone formation, leaving the intemperate Suwarora
behind. We entered a fine forest at a stiff pace until we arrived
at the head of a deep valley called Lohugati which was so beautiful
we instinctively pulled up to admire it. Deep down its well-wooded
side was a stream of most inviting aspect for a trout-fisher,
flowing towards the N'yanza. Just beyond it, the valley was clothed
with fine trees and luxuriant vegetation of all description,
amongst which was conspicuous the pretty pandana palm and rich
gardens of plantains, whilst thistles of extraordinary size and
wild indigo were the common weeds.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more agreeable than our stay at Karagu&eacute;,
our next stopping place, where we found Rumanika, its intelligent
king, sitting in a wrapper made of antelope's skin, smiling blandly
as we approached him. He talked of the geography of the lake, and
by his invitation we crossed the Spur to the Ing&eacute;zi
Kag&eacute;ra side, showing by actual navigation the connection of
these highland lakes with the rivers which drain the various spurs
of the Mountains of the Moon. Rumanika also<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span> told me that in
R&uuml;nda there existed pigmies who lived in trees, but
occasionally came down at night, and listening at the hut doors of
the men, would wait till they heard the name of one of its inmates,
when they would call him out, and firing an arrow into his heart,
disappear again in the same way as they came. After a long and
amusing conversation, I was introduced to his sister-in-law, a
wonder of obesity, unable to stand, except on all fours. Meanwhile,
the daughter, a lass of sixteen, sat before us sucking at a
milk-pot, on which her father kept her at work by holding a rod in
his hand, as fattening is the first duty of fashionable female
life.</p>

<p>During my stay I had traced Rumanika's descent from King David,
whose hair was as straight as my own, and he found in these
theological disclosures the greatest delight. He wished to know
what difference existed between the Arabs and ourselves, to which
Baraka replied, as the best means of making him understand, that
whilst the Arabs had only one book, we had two, to which I added,
"Yes, that is true in a sense, but the real merits lie in the fact
that we have got the better book, as may be inferred by the obvious
fact that we are more prosperous and superior in all things."</p>

<p>One day, we heard the familiar sound of the Uganda drum. Maula,
a royal officer, with an escort of smartly-dressed men and women
and boys, had brought a welcome from the king. One thing only now
embarrassed me&mdash;Grant was worse, without hope of recovery for
some months. This large body of Waganda could not be kept waiting.
To get on as fast as possible was the only chance of ever bringing
the journey to a successful issue. So, unable to help myself, with
great remorse at another separation, on the following day I
consigned my companion, with several Wanguana, to the care of my
friend Rumanika. When all was completed, I set out on the march,
perfectly sure in my mind that before very long I should settle the
great Nile problem for ever, and with<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span> this consciousness,
only hoping that Grant would be able to join me before I should
have to return again, for it was never supposed for a moment that
it was possible I ever could get north from Uganda.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;A Distinguished Guest at the
Court of Uganda</i></div>

<p>As it was my lot to spend a considerable time in Uganda, I
formed a theory of its ethnology, founded on the traditions of the
several nations and my own observation. In my judgment, they are of
the semi-Shem-Hamitic race of Ethiopia, at some early date having,
from Abyssinia, invaded the rich pasture lands of Unyoro, and
founded the great kingdom of Kittara. Here they lost their
religion, forgot their language, and changed their national name to
Wahuma, their traditional idea being still of a foreign extraction.
We note one very distinguishing mark, the physical appearance of
this remarkable race partaking more of the phlegmatic nature of the
Shemitic father, than the nervous boisterous temperament of the
Hamitic mother, as a certain clue to their Shem-Hamitic origin.</p>

<p>Before, however, I had advanced much farther over the frontiers
of this new country, I had a rather spirited scene with my new
commander-in-chief (Baraka being left with Grant) on a point of
discipline. I ordered him one morning to strike the tent; he made
some excuses. "Never mind, obey my orders, and strike the
tent."</p>

<p>Bombay refused, and I began to pull it down myself, at which he
flew into a passion, and said he would pitch into the men who
helped me, as there was gunpowder which might blow us all up. I
promptly remonstrated:</p>

<p>"That's no reason why you should abuse my men, who are better
than you by obeying my orders. If I choose to blow up my property,
that is my look-out; and if you don't do your duty, I will blow you
up also."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">
258</a></span>As Bombay foamed with rage at this, I gave him a dig on the head
with my fist, and when he squared up to me, I gave him another,
till at last as the claret was flowing, he sulked off. Crowds of
Waganda witnessed this comedy, and were all digging at one
another's heads, showing off in pantomime the strange ways of the
white man.</p>

<p>It was the first and last time I had ever occasion to lose my
dignity by striking a blow with my own hands, but I could not help
it on this occasion without losing command and respect.</p>

<p>On February 19, Mt&eacute;sa, the King of Uganda, sent his pages
to announce a lev&eacute;e at the palace in my honour. I prepared
for my presentation at court in my best, but cut a sorry figure in
comparison with the dressy Waganda. The preliminary ceremonies were
so dilatory, that I allowed five minutes to the court to give me a
proper reception, saying if it were not conceded, I would then walk
away. My men feared for me, as they did not know what a "savage"
king would do in case I carried out my threat; whilst the Waganda,
lost in amazement at what seemed little less than blasphemy, saw me
walk away homeward, leaving Bombay to leave the present on the
ground and follow.</p>

<p>Mt&eacute;sa thought of leaving his toilet room to catch me up,
but sent Wakungu running after me. Poor creatures! They caught me
up, fell upon their knees and implored I would return at once, for
the king had not tasted food, and would not till he saw me. I felt
grieved, but simply replied by patting my heart and shaking my
head, walking, if anything, all the faster. My point gained I
cooled myself with coffee and a pipe, and returned, advancing into
the hut where sat the king, a good-looking, well-figured young man
of twenty-five, with hair cut short, and wearing neat ornaments on
his neck, arms, fingers and toes. A white dog, spear, shield, and
woman&mdash;the Uganda cognizance&mdash;were by his side. Not
knowing the language, we sat staring at each other for an<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">
259</a></span> hour, but in the second interview Maula translated.
On that occasion I took a ring from my finger and presented it to
the king with the words:</p>

<p>"This is a small token of friendship; please inspect it, it is
made after the fashion of a dog collar, and being the king of
metals, gold, is in every respect appropriate to your illustrious
race."</p>

<p>To which compliment he replied: "If friendship is your desire,
what would you say if I showed you a road by which you might reach
your home in a month?"</p>

<p>I knew he referred to the direct line to Zanzibar across the
Masai. He afterwards sent a page with this message:</p>

<p>"The king hopes you will not be offended if required to sit on
it&mdash;a bundle of grass&mdash;before him, for no person in
Uganda, however high in office, is ever allowed to sit upon
anything raised above the ground but the king."</p>

<p>To this I agreed, and afterwards had many interviews with his
queen, fair, fat and forty-five, to whom I administered medicine
and found her the key to any influence with the king. She often sat
chattering, laughing and smoking her pipe in concert with me.</p>

<p>I found that Mt&eacute;sa was always on the look-out for
presents, and set his heart upon having my compass. I told him he
might as well put my eyes out and ask me to walk home as take away
that little instrument, which could be of no use to him as he could
not read or understand it. But this only excited his cupidity. He
watched it twirling round and pointing to the north and looked and
begged again until tired of his importunities, I told him I must
wait until the Usoga Road was open before I could part with it, and
then the compass would be nothing to what I would give him. Hearing
this, he reared his head proudly, and patting his heart, said:</p>

<p>"That is all on my shoulders, as sure as I live it shall be
done. For that country has no king and I have long been desirous of
taking it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id=
"Page_260">260</a></span>I declined, however, to give him the instrument on the security
of this promise, and he went to breakfast.</p>

<p>I had a brilliant instance of the capricious restlessness and
self-willedness of this despotic monarch Mt&eacute;sa. He sent word
that he had started for N'yanza and wished me to follow. But
N'yanza merely means a piece of water, and no one knew where he
meant or what project was on foot. I walked rapidly through
gardens, over hills and across rushy swamps down the west flank of
the Murchison creek, and found the king with his Wakungu in front
and women behind like a confused pack of hounds. He had first, it
seems, mingled a little business with pleasure, for, finding a
woman tied for some offence, he took the executioner's duty, and by
firing killed her outright.</p>

<p>It will be kept in view that the hanging about at this court and
all the perplexing and irritating negotiations had always one end
in view&mdash;that of reaching the Nile, where it pours out of the
N'yanza as I was long certain that it did.</p>

<p>Without the consent, and even the aid, of this capricious
barbarian I was now talking to, such a project was hopeless. I
thought that whilst I could be employed in inspecting the river and
in feeling the route by water to Gani, Grant could return to
Karagu&eacute; by water, bring up our rear traps, and in navigating
the lake obtain the information he had been frustrated in getting
before.</p>

<p>We resolved to try a new political influence at court. Grant had
taken to the court of Karagu&eacute; a jumping-jack to amuse the
young princess, but it gave offence here as a breach of
etiquette.</p>

<p>Finally we bade Mt&eacute;sa good-bye. I flattered him with
admiration of his shooting, his country, and the possibilities of
trade in the future, to which he replied in good taste. We then
rose with an English bow, placing the hand on the heart while
saying adieu, and there was a complete uniformity in the
ceremonial, for whatever I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261"
id="Page_261">261</a></span> did, Mt&eacute;sa in an instant
mimicked with the instinct of a monkey.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Source Confirmed At
Last</i></div>

<p>The final stage of our toilsome travelling was now reached, and
we started northward, but as it appeared all-important to
communicate quickly with Petherick, who had promised to await us
with boats at Gondokoro, and Grant's leg being so weak, I arranged
for him to go direct with my property, letters, etc., for dispatch
to Petherick. I should meanwhile go up the river to its source or
exit from the lake and come down again navigating as far as
practicable. Crossing the Luajerri, a huge rush drain three miles
broad, which is said to rise in the lake and fall into the Nile, I
reached Urondogani.</p>

<p>Here, at last I stood on the brink of the Nile; most beautiful
was the scene, nothing could surpass it! It was the very perfection
of the kind of effect aimed at in a highly-kept park, with a
magnificent stream from 600 to 700 yards wide, dotted with islets
and rocks, the former occupied by fishermen's huts, the latter by
sterns and crocodiles basking in the sun&mdash;flowing between fine
high, grassy banks, with rich trees and plaintains in the
background, where herds of the nsunnu and hartebeest could be seen
grazing, while the hippopotami were snorting in the water and
florikan and guinea-fowl rising at our feet.</p>

<p>The expedition had now performed its functions. I saw that old
Father Nile, without any doubt, rises in the Victoria N'yanza! I
told my men they ought to shave their heads and bathe in the holy
river, the cradle of Moses, the waters of which, sweetened with
sugar, men carried all the way from Egypt to Mecca and sell to the
pilgrims. But Bombay, who is a philosopher of the Epicurean school,
said:</p>

<p>"We don't look on those things in the same fanciful manner that
you do, we are contented with all the common-places<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span> of life
and look for nothing beyond the present. If things don't go well,
it is God's will; and if they do go well, that is His will
also."</p>

<p>I mourned, however, when I thought how much I had lost by the
delays in the journey having deprived me of the pleasure of going
to look at the north-east corner of the N'yanza to see what
connection there was with it and the other lake where the Waganda
went to get their salt, and from which another river flowed to the
north making "Usoga an island." But I felt I ought to be content
with what I had been spared to accomplish.</p>

<p>The most remote waters or <i>tophead of the Nile</i> is the
southern end of the lake, situated close on the third degree of
south latitude, which gives to the Nile the surprising length in
direct measurement, rolling over thirty-four degrees of latitude,
of above 2,300 miles or more than one-eleventh the circumference of
our globe. I now christened what the natives term "the stones" as
Ripon Falls after the nobleman who presided over the Royal
Geographical Society when my expedition was got up, and the arm of
water from which the Nile issued Napoleon Channel, in token of
respect to the French Geographical Society who gave me their gold
medal for discovering the Victoria N'yanza.</p>

<p>After a long journey to Gani we reached the habitation of men,
knots of native fellows perched like monkeys on the granite blocks
awaited us, and finally at Gondokoro we got first news of home and
came down by boat to Khartum. Of course, in disbanding my
followers, my faithful children, I duly rewarded them, franked them
home to Zanzibar, and they all promptly volunteered to go with me
again.</p>

<h4>LAURENCE STERNE</h4>

<h4>A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Setting Out</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>No literary career has ever been more singular than that of
Laurence Sterne. Born in Clonmel Barracks, Ireland, on November 24,
1713, he was forty-six years of age before he discovered his
genius. By calling he was a country parson in Yorkshire, yet more
unconventional books than "Tristram Shandy" (see <span class=
"smcap">Fiction</span>) and "A Sentimental Journey" never appeared.
The fame of the former brought Sterne to London, where he became,
says Walpole, "topsy-turvey with success." In the intervals of
supplying an ever increasing demand with more "Tristrams" he
composed and published volumes of sermons. Their popularity proved
that he was as eloquent in his pulpit gown as he was diverting
without it. The turmoil of eighteenth century social and literary
life soon shattered his already failing health, and he died on
March 18, 1768, the first two volumes of "A Sentimental Journey"
appearing on February 27th. The "Journey" proved equally as
fascinating and as popular as "Shandy." Walpole, who described the
latter as tiresome, declared the new book to be "very pleasing
though too much dilated, and marked by great good nature and
strokes of delicacy." Like its predecessor, the "Journey" is
intentionally formless&mdash;narrative and digression, pathos and
wit, sentiment and coarse indelicacy, all commingled freely
together.</p>
</div>

<p>"They order," said I, "this matter better in France." "You have
been in France?" said my gentleman, turning quick upon me with the
most civil triumph in the world. Strange! quoth I, debating the
matter with myself, that one and twenty miles' sailing, for 'tis
absolutely no further from Dover to Calais, should give a man these
rights: I'll look into them; so giving up the argument, I went
straight to my lodgings, put up half-a-dozen shirts and a black
pair of silk breeches,&mdash;"the coat I have on," said I, looking
at the sleeve, "will do,"&mdash;took place in the Dover stage; and,
the packet sailing at nine the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span> next morning, by three
I had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricasseed
chicken&mdash;incontestably in France.</p>

<p>When I had finished my dinner, and drank the King of France's
health&mdash;to satisfy my mind that I bore him no spleen, but, on
the contrary, high honour to the humanity of his temper&mdash;I
rose up an inch taller for the accommodation. "Just God!" said I,
kicking my portmanteau aside, "what is there in this world's goods
which should sharpen our spirits, and make so many kind-hearted
brethren of us fall out so cruelly as we do, by the way?"</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Monk&mdash;Calais</i></div>

<p>I had scarce uttered the words when a poor monk of the order of
St. Francis came into the room to beg something for his convent. No
man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingencies. The
moment I cast my eyes upon him, I was determined not to give him a
single sou; and accordingly I put my purse into my
pocket&mdash;button'd it up&mdash;set myself a little more upon my
centre, and advanced up gravely to him; there was something, I
fear, forbidding in my look: I have his figure this moment before
my eyes, and think there was that in it which deserved better.</p>

<p>The monk, as I judged from the break in his tonsure, a few
scatter'd white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of
it, might be about seventy&mdash;he was certainly sixty-five.</p>

<p>It was one of those heads which Guido has often
painted&mdash;mild, pale, penetrating, free from all commonplace
ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the
earth&mdash;it look'd forwards; but look'd as if it look'd at
something beyond this world.</p>

<p>When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and
laying his left hand upon his breast, when I had got close up to
him, he introduced himself with the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span> little story of the
wants of his convent, and the poverty of his order&mdash;and he did
it with so simple a grace&mdash;I was bewitch'd not to have been
struck with it.</p>

<p>A better reason was, I had predetermined not to give him a
single sou.</p>

<p>"'Tis very true," said I, "'tis very true&mdash;and Heaven be
their resource who have no other but the charity of the world, the
stock of which, I fear, is no way sufficient for the many <i>great
claims</i> which are hourly made upon it."</p>

<p>As I pronounced the words <i>great claims</i>, he gave a single
glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunic&mdash;I
felt the full force of the appeal. "I acknowledge it," said I, "a
coarse habit, and that but once in three years, with meagre
diet&mdash;are no great matters; and the true point of pity is, as
they can be earn'd in the world with so little industry, that your
order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is
the property of the lame, the blind, the aged, and the infirm; and
had you been of the <i>order of mercy</i>, instead of the order of
St. Francis, poor as I am," continued I, pointing at my
portmanteau, "full cheerfully should it have been open'd to you,
for the ransom of the unfortunate"&mdash;the monk made me a
bow&mdash;"but of all others," resumed I, "the unfortunate of our
own country, surely, have the first rights; and I have left
thousands in distress upon our own shore." The monk gave a cordial
wave with his head, as much as to say, "No doubt, there is misery
enough in every corner of the world, as well as within our
convent." "But we distinguish," said I, laying my hand upon the
sleeve of his tunic, "we distinguish, my good father! betwixt those
who wish only to eat the bread of their own labour&mdash;and those
who eat the bread of other people's, and have no other plan in
life, but to get through it in sloth and ignorance, <i>for the love
of God</i>."</p>

<p>The poor Franciscan made no reply: a hectic of a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
moment pass'd across his cheeks, but could not tarry. Nature seemed
to have done with her resentments in him; he showed none, but
press'd both his hands with resignation upon his breast and
retired.</p>

<p>My heart smote me the moment he shut the door. "Psha!" said I,
with an air of carelessness, but it would not do: every ungracious
syllable I had utter'd crowded back into my imagination. I
reflected, I had no right over the poor Franciscan, but to deny
him; I consider'd his grey hairs&mdash;his courteous figure seem'd
to re-enter and gently ask me what injury he had done me? And why I
could use him thus? I would have given twenty livres for an
advocate&mdash;I have behaved very ill, said I, within myself; but
I have only just set out upon my travels, and shall learn better
manners as I get along.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;The Remise
Door&mdash;Calais</i></div>

<p>Now, there being no travelling through France and Italy without
a chaise&mdash;and Nature generally prompting us to the thing we
are fittest for, I walk'd out into the coach yard to buy or hire
something of that kind to my purpose. Mons. Dessein, the master of
the hotel, having just returned from vespers, we walk'd together
towards his remise, to take a view of his magazine of chaises.
Suddenly I had turned upon a lady who had just arrived at the inn
and had followed us unperceived, and whom I had already seen in
conference with the Franciscan.</p>

<p>Monsieur Dessein had <i>diabled</i> the key above fifty times
before he found out that he had come with a wrong one in his hand:
we were as impatient as himself to have it open'd, when he left us
together, with our faces towards the door, and said he would be
back in five minutes. "This, certainly, fair lady!" said I, "must
be one of Fortune's whimsical doings; to take two utter<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
strangers by their hands, and in one moment place them together in
such a cordial situation as Friendship herself could scarce have
achieved for them." Then I set myself to consider how I should undo
the ill impressions which the poor monk's story, in case he had
told it to her, must have planted in her breast against me.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The
Snuff-box&mdash;Calais</i></div>

<p>The good old monk was within six paces from us, as the idea of
him cross'd my mind; and was advancing towards us a little out of
the line, as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no.
He stopp'd, however, as soon as he came up to us, with a world of
frankness: and having a horn snuff-box in his hand, he presented it
open to me. "You shall taste mine," said I, pulling out my box
(which was a small tortoise one), and putting it into his hand.
"'Tis most excellent," said the monk. "Then do me the favour," I
replied, "to accept of the box and all, and, when you take a pinch
out of it, sometimes recollect it was the peace-offering of a man
who once used you unkindly, but not from his heart."</p>

<p>The poor monk blush'd as red as scarlet. "<i>Mon Dieu</i>," said
he, pressing his hands together, "You never used me unkindly." "I
should think," said the lady, "he is not likely." I blush'd in my
turn. "Excuse me, Madam," replied I, "I treated him most unkindly;
and from no provocations." "'Tis impossible," said the lady. "My
God!" cried the monk, with a warmth of asseveration which seem'd
not to belong to him, "The fault was in me, and in the indiscretion
of my zeal." The lady opposed it, and I joined with her in
maintaining it was impossible, that a spirit so regulated as his
could give offence to any.</p>

<p>Whilst this contention lasted the monk rubb'd his horn box upon
the sleeve of his tunic; and as soon as it had acquired a little
air of brightness by the friction, he<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span> made a low bow, and
said 'twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness
of our tempers which had involved us in this contest. But be it as
it would, he begg'd we might exchange boxes. In saying this, he
presented his to me with one hand, as he took mine from me in the
other; and having kissed it, he put it into his bosom and took his
leave.</p>

<p>I guard this box, as I would the instrumental parts of my
religion, to help mind on to something better; truth, I seldom go
abroad without it: and oft and many a time have I called up by it
the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own, in the
justlings of the world; they had full employment for his, as I
learnt from his story, till about the forty-fifth year of his age,
when upon some military services ill requited, and meeting at the
same time with a disappointment in the tenderness of passions, he
abandoned the sword and the sex together, and took sanctuary, not
so much in his convent as in himself.</p>

<p>I felt a damp upon my spirits, that in my last return through
Calais, upon inquiring after Father Lorengo, I heard he had been
dead near three months, and was buried not in his convent, but,
according to his desire, in a little cemetery belonging to it,
about two leagues off; I had a strong desire to see where they had
laid him&mdash;when upon pulling out his little horn box, as I sat
by his grave, and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it,
which had no business to grow there, they all struck together so
forcibly upon my affections, that I burst into a flood of
tears&mdash;but I am as weak as a woman; and I beg the world not to
smile but to pity me.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;Montreuil</i></div>

<p>I had once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise, and twice
got out in the rain, and one of the times up to the knees in dirt,
to help the postillion to tie it<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span> on, without being able
to find out what was wanting. Nor was it till I got to Montreuil,
upon the landlord's asking me if I wanted not a servant, that it
occurred to me, that that was the very thing.</p>

<p>"A servant! That I do most sadly!" quoth I. "Because, Monsieur,"
said the landlord, "there is a clever young fellow, who would be
very proud of the honour to serve an Englishman." "But, why an
English one more than any other?" "They are so generous," said the
landlord. I'll be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket,
quoth I to myself, this very night. "But they have wherewithal to
be so, Monsieur," added he. Set down one livre more for that, quoth
I.</p>

<p>The landlord then called in La Fleur, which was the name of the
young man he had spoke of&mdash;saying only first, that as for his
talents, he would presume to say nothing&mdash;Monsieur was the
best judge what would suit him; but for the fidelity of La Fleur,
he would stand responsible in all he was worth.</p>

<p>The landlord deliver'd this in a manner which instantly set my
mind to the business I was upon&mdash;and La Fleur, who stood
waiting without, in that breathless expectation which every son of
nature of us has felt in our turns, came in.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VI.&mdash;Montreuil&mdash;La Fleur</i></div>

<p>I am apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight;
but never more so, than when a poor devil comes to offer his
services to so poor a devil as myself.</p>

<p>When La Fleur entered the room, the genuine look and air of the
fellow determined the matter at once in his favour; so I hired him
first&mdash;and then began to enquire what he could do. But I shall
find out his talents, quoth I, as I want them. Besides, a Frenchman
can do everything.</p>

<p>Now poor La Fleur could do nothing in the world but<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span> beat
a drum, and play a march or two upon the pipe. I was determined to
make his talents do: and can't say my weakness was ever so insulted
by my wisdom, as in the attempt.</p>

<p>La Fleur had set out early in life, as gallantly as most
Frenchmen do, with <i>serving</i> for a few years: at the end of
which, having satisfied the sentiment, and found moreover, that the
honour of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward, as it
open'd no further track of glory to him&mdash;he retired
<i>&agrave; ses terres</i>, and lived <i>comme il plaisait &agrave;
Dieu</i>&mdash;that is to say, upon nothing.</p>

<p>"But you can do something else, La Fleur?" said I. O yes, he
could make spatterdashes (leather riding gaiters), and play a
little upon the fiddle. "Why, I play bass myself," said I; "we
shall do very well. You can shave and dress a wig a little, La
Fleur?" He had all the disposition in the world. "It is enough for
Heaven!" said I, interrupting him, "and ought to be enough for me!"
So supper coming in, and having a frisky English spaniel on one
side of my chair, and a French valet with as much hilarity in his
countenance as ever Nature painted in one, on the other, I was
satisfied to my heart's content with my empire; and if monarchs
knew what they would be at, they might be satisfied as I was.</p>

<p>As La Fleur went the whole tour of France and Italy with me, I
must interest the reader in his behalf, by saying that I had never
less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine
me, than in regard to this fellow. He was a faithful, affectionate,
simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher; and
notwithstanding his talents of drum-beating and spatterdash making,
which, though very good in themselves, happened to be of no great
service to me, yet was I hourly recompensed by the festivity of his
temper&mdash;it supplied all defects. I had a constant resource in
his looks, in all difficulties and distresses of my own&mdash;I was
going to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id=
"Page_271">271</a></span> added, of his too; but La Fleur was
out of the reach of everything; for whether it was hunger or
thirst, or cold or nakedness, or watchings, or whatever stripes of
ill luck La Fleur met with in our journeyings, there was no index
in his physiognomy to point them out by&mdash;he was eternally the
same; so that if I am a piece of a philosopher, which Satan now and
then puts it into my head I am&mdash;it always mortifies the pride
of the conceit, by reflecting how much I owe to the complexional
philosophy of this poor fellow for shaming me into one of a better
kind.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;The
Passport&mdash;Paris</i></div>

<p>When I got home to my hotel, La Fleur told me I had been
enquired after by the lieutenant of police. "The deuce take it,"
said I, "I know the reason."</p>

<p>I had left London with so much precipitation that it never
enter'd my mind that we were at war with France; and had reached
Dover, and looked through my glass at the hills beyond Boulogne,
before the idea presented itself; and with this in its train, that
there was no getting there without a passport. Go but to the end of
a street, I have a mortal aversion for returning back no wiser than
I set out; and as this was one of the greatest efforts I had ever
made for knowledge, I could less bear the thoughts of it; so
hearing the Count de &mdash;&mdash; had buried the packet, I begged
he would take me in his <i>suite</i>. The count had some little
knowledge of me, so made little or no difficulty&mdash;only said
his inclination to serve me could reach no further than Calais, as
he was to return by way of Brussels to Paris; however, when I had
once passed there I might get to Paris without interruption; but
that in Paris I must make friends and shift for myself. "Let me get
to Paris, Monsieur le Comte," said I, "and I shall do very well."
So I embark'd, and never thought more of the matter.</p>

<p><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>When La Fleur told me the lieutenant of police had been
enquiring after me&mdash;the thing instantly recurred&mdash;and by
the time La Fleur had well told me, the master of the hotel came
into my room to tell me the same thing with this addition to it,
that my passport had been particularly asked after. The master of
the hotel concluded with saying he hoped I had one. "Not I, faith!"
said I.</p>

<p>The master of the hotel retired three steps from me, as from an
infected person, as I declared this, and poor La Fleur advanced
three steps towards me, and with that sort of movement which a good
soul makes to succour a distress'd one&mdash;the fellow won my
heart by it; and from that single <i>trait</i> I knew his character
as perfectly, and could rely upon it as firmly, as if he had served
me with fidelity for seven years.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Seigneur!</i>" cried the master of the hotel&mdash;but
recollecting himself as he made the exclamation, he instantly
changed the tone of it&mdash;"If Monsieur," said he, "has not a
passport, in all likelihood he has friends in Paris who can procure
him one."</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," quoth I, with an air of indifference.</p>

<p>"Then, <i>certes</i>," replied he, "you'll be sent to the
Bastille or the Chatelet, <i>au moins</i>."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said I, "the King of France is a good-natur'd
soul&mdash;he'll hurt nobody."</p>

<p>"<i>Cela n'emp&egrave;che pas</i>," said he&mdash;"You will
certainly be sent to the Bastille to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"But I've taken your lodgings for a month," answered I, "and
I'll not quit them a day before the time for all the kings of
France in the world." La Fleur whispered in my ear, that nobody
could oppose the King of France.</p>

<p>"<i>Pardi!</i>" said my host, "<i>ces Messieurs Anglais sont des
gens tr&egrave;s extraordinaires</i>"&mdash;And having said and
sworn it he went out.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id=
"Page_273">273</a></span><i>VII.&mdash;Le
P&acirc;tissier&mdash;Versailles</i></div>

<p>As I am at Versailles, thought I, why should I not go to the
Count de B&mdash;&mdash;, and tell him my story? So seeing a man
standing with a basket on the other side of the street, as if he
had something to sell, I bid La Fleur go up to him and enquire for
the count's hotel.</p>

<p>La Fleur returned a little pale; and told me it was a Chevalier
de St. Louis selling p&acirc;t&eacute;s. He had seen the croix set
in gold, with its red ribband, he said, tied to his
button-hole&mdash;and had looked into the basket and seen the
p&acirc;t&eacute;s which the chevalier was selling.</p>

<p>Such a reverse in man's life awakens a better principle than
curiosity&mdash;I got out of the carriage and went towards him. He
was begirt with a clean linen apron, which fell below his knees,
and with a sort of bib that went half way-up his breast; upon the
top of this hung his croix. His basket of little p&acirc;t&eacute;s
was covered over with a white damask napkin; and there was a look
of <i>propret&eacute;</i> and neatness throughout, that one might
have bought his p&acirc;t&eacute;s of him, as much from appetite as
sentiment.</p>

<p>He was about 48&mdash;of a sedate look, something approaching to
gravity. I did not wonder&mdash;I went up rather to the basket than
him, and having lifted up the napkin, and taken one of his
p&acirc;t&eacute;s into my hand I begged he would explain the
appearance which affected me.</p>

<p>He told me in a few words, that the best part of his life had
pass'd in the service, in which he had obtained a company and the
croix with it; but that, at the conclusion of the last peace, his
regiment being re-formed and the whole corps left without any
provision, he found himself in a wide world without friends,
without a livre&mdash;"And indeed," said he, "without anything but
this" (pointing, as he said it, to his croix). The king<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
could neither relieve nor reward everyone, and it was only his
misfortune to be amongst the number. He had a little wife, he said,
whom he loved, who did the <i>p&acirc;tisserie</i>; and added, he
felt no dishonour in defending her and himself from want in this
way&mdash;unless Providence had offer'd him a better.</p>

<p>It would be wicked to pass over what happen'd to this poor
Chevalier of St. Louis about nine months after.</p>

<p>It seems his story reach'd at last the king's ear&mdash;who,
hearing the chevalier had been a gallant officer, broke up his
little trade by a pension of 1,500 livres a year.</p>

<h4>VOLTAIRE</h4>

<h4>Letters on the English</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The Quakers</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Voltaire (see <span class="smcap">History</span>) reached
England in 1726. He had quarrelled with a great noble, and the
great noble's lackeys had roundly thrashed him. Voltaire
accordingly issued a challenge to a duel; his adversary's reply was
to get him sent to prison, from which he was released on condition
that he leave immediately for England. He remained there until
1729, and these three years may fairly be said to have been the
making of Voltaire. He went with a reputation as an elegant young
poet and dramatist&mdash;he was then thirty-two; and this
reputation brought him into the society of the most famous
political and literary personages of the day. He became a disciple
of Newton, and gained a broad, if not a deep, knowledge of
philosophy. He left in 1729 fully equipped for his later and
greater career as philosopher, historian, and satirist. The
"Philosophic Letters on the English" were definitely published,
after various difficulties, in 1734; an English translation,
however, appeared in 1733. The difficulties did not cease with
publication, for the French authorities were grievously displeased
with Voltaire's acid comparisons between the political and
intellectual liberty enjoyed by Englishmen with the bondage of his
own countrymen. The "Philosophic Letters" purported to be addressed
to the author's friend Theriot; but they would seem to be essays in
an epistolary form rather than actual correspondence. Of England
and its people, Voltaire was both an observant and an appreciative
critic; hosts and guest alike had reason to be pleased with his
long and profitable visit.</p>
</div>

<p>My curiosity having been aroused regarding the doctrines and
history of these singular people, I sought to satisfy it by a visit
to one of the most celebrated of English Quakers. He was a
well-preserved old man, who had never known illness, because he had
never yielded to passion or intemperance; not in all my life have I
seen a man of an aspect at once so noble and so engaging. He
received me with his hat on his head,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span> and advanced
towards me without the slightest bow; but there was far more
courtesy in the open kindliness of his countenance than is to be
seen in the custom of dragging one leg behind the other, or of
holding in the hand that which was meant to cover the head.</p>

<p>"Sir," I said, bowing low, and gliding one foot towards him,
after our manner, "I flatter myself that my honest curiosity will
not displease you, and that you will be willing to do me the honour
of instructing me as to your religion."</p>

<p>"The folk of thy country," he replied, "are too prone to paying
compliments and making reverences; but I have never seen one of
them who had the same curiosity as thou. Enter, and let us dine
together."</p>

<p>After a healthy and frugal meal, I set myself to questioning
him. I opened with the old enquiry of good Catholics to Huguenots.
"My dear sir," I said to him, "have you been baptised?"</p>

<p>"No," answered the Quaker, "neither I nor my brethren."</p>

<p>"<i>Morbleu!</i>" I replied, "then you are not Christians?"</p>

<p>"Swear not, my son," he said gently; "we try to be good
Christians; but we believe not that Christianity consists in
throwing cold water on the head, with a little salt."</p>

<p>"<i>Ventrebleu!</i>" I retorted, "have you forgotten that Jesus
Christ was baptised by John?"</p>

<p>"Once more, my friend, no swearing," replied the mild Quaker.
"Christ was baptised by John, but himself baptised no one. We are
disciples of Christ, not of John."</p>

<p>He proceeded to give me briefly the reasons for some
peculiarities which expose this sect to the sneers of others.
"Confess," he said, "that thou hast had much ado not to smile at my
accepting thy courtesies with my hat on my head, and at my calling
thee 'thou.' Yet thou must surely know that at the time of Christ
no nation was so foolish as to substitute the plural for the
singular.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">
277</a></span> It was not until long afterwards that men began to
call each other 'you' instead of 'thou,' as if they were double,
and to usurp the impudent titles of Majesty, Eminence, Holiness,
that some worms of the earth bestow on other worms. It is the
better to guard ourselves against this unworthy interchange of lies
and flatteries that we address kings and cobblers in the same
terms, and offer salutations to nobody; since for men we have
nothing but charity, and respect only for the laws.</p>

<p>"We don a costume differing a little from that of other men as a
constant reminder that we are unlike them. Others wear the tokens
of their dignities; we wear those of Christian humility. We never
take an oath, not even in a court of justice; for we think that the
name of the Almighty should not be prostituted in the miserable
wranglings of men. We never go to war&mdash;not because we fear
death; on the contrary, we bless the moment that unites us with the
Being of Beings; but because we are not wolves, nor tigers, nor
bulldogs, but Christian men, whom God has commanded to love our
enemies and suffer without murmuring. When London is illuminated
after a victory, when the air is filled with the pealing of bells
and the roar of cannon, we mourn in silence over the murders that
have stirred the people to rejoice."</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Anglicans and
Presbyterians</i></div>

<p>This is the land of sects. An Englishman is a free man, and goes
to Heaven by any road he pleases.</p>

<p>But although anybody may serve God after his own fashion, their
true religion, the one in which fortunes are made, is the Episcopal
sect, called the Anglican Church, or, simply and pre-eminently, the
Church. No office can be held in England or Ireland except by
faithful Anglicans; a circumstance which has led to the conversion
of many Noncomformists.</p>

<p>The Anglican clergy have retained many Catholic ceremonies,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">
278</a></span> above all that of receiving tithes with a
most scrupulous attention. They have also a pious ambition for
religious ascendancy, and do what they can to foment a holy zeal
against Nonconformists. But a Whig ministry is just now in power,
and the Whigs are hostile to Episcopacy. They have prohibited the
lower clergy from meeting in convocation, a sort of clerical house
of commons; and the clergy are limited to the obscurity of their
parishes, and to the melancholy task of praying God for a
government that they would be only too happy to disturb. The
bishops, however, sit in the House of Lords in spite of the Whigs,
because the old abuse continues of counting them as barons.</p>

<p>As regards morals, the Anglican clergy are better regulated than
those of France, for these reasons:&mdash;they are all educated at
Oxford or Cambridge, far from the corruption of the capital; and
they are only called to high church office late in life, at an age
when men have lost every passion but avarice. They do not make
bishops or colonels here of young men fresh from college. Moreover,
the clergy are nearly all married, and the ill manners contracted
at the universities, and the slightness of the intercourse between
men and women, oblige a bishop as a rule to be content with his own
wife. Priests sometimes frequent inns, for custom permits it; and
if they get drunk, they do so discreetly and without scandal.</p>

<p>When English clergymen hear that in France young men, famous for
their dissipations, and elevated to bishoprics by the intrigues of
women, make love publicly, amuse themselves by writing amorous
ballads, give elaborate suppers every day, and, in addition, pray
for the light of the Holy Spirit, and boldly call themselves the
successors of the Apostles; the Englishmen thank God that they are
Protestants. But they are vile heretics, to be burnt by all the
devils, as Rabelais puts it; which is the reason why I have nothing
to do with them.</p>

<p>The Anglican religion only embraces England and Ireland.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Presbyterianism, which is Calvanism pure and simple, is the
dominant religion in Scotland. Its ministers affect a sober gait
and an air of displeasure, wear enormous hats, and long cloaks over
short coats, preach through their noses, and give the name of
"Scarlet Woman" to all churches who have ecclesiastics fortunate
enough to draw fifty thousand livres of income, and laymen
good-natured enough to stand it.</p>

<p>Although the Episcopal and Presbyterian sects are the two
prevailing ones in Great Britain, all others are welcome, and all
live fairly well together; although most of their preachers detest
each other with all the heartiness of a Jansenist damning a
Jesuit.</p>

<p>Were there but one religion in England, there would be a danger
of despotism; were there but two, they would cut each other's
throats. But there are thirty, and accordingly they dwell together
in peace and happiness.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;The Government</i></div>

<p>The members of the English Parliament are fond of comparing
themselves with the ancient Romans; but except that there are some
senators in London who are suspected, wrongly, no doubt, of selling
their votes, I can see nothing in common between Rome and England.
The two nations, for good or ill, are entirely different.</p>

<p>The horrible folly of religious wars was unknown among the
Romans; this abomination has been reserved for the devotees of a
faith of humility and patience. But a more essential difference
between Rome and England, and one in which the latter has all the
advantage, is that the fruit of the Roman civil wars was slavery,
while that of the English civil wars has been liberty. The English
nation is the only one on earth that has succeeded in tempering the
power of kings by resisting them. By effort upon effort it has
succeeded in establishing a wise government in which the Prince,
all-powerful for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id=
"Page_280">280</a></span> doing of good, has his hands tied
for the doing of evil; where the nobles are great without insolence
and without vassals; and where the people, without confusion, take
their due share in the control of national affairs.</p>

<p>The Houses of Lords and Commons are the arbiters of the nation,
the King is the over-arbiter. This balance was lacking among the
Romans; nobles and people were always at issue, and there was no
intermediary power to reconcile them.</p>

<p>It has cost a great deal, no doubt, to establish liberty in
England; the idol of despotic power has been drowned in seas of
blood. But the English do not think they have bought their freedom
at too high a price. Other nations have not had fewer troubles,
have not shed less blood; but the blood they have shed in the cause
of their liberty has but cemented their servitude.</p>

<p>This happy concert of King, Lords, and Commons in the government
of England has not always existed. England was for ages a country
sorely oppressed. But in the clashes of kings and nobles, it
fortunately happens that the bonds of the peoples are more or less
relaxed. English liberty was born of the quarrels of tyrants. The
chief object of the famous Magna Charta, let it be admitted, was to
place the kings in dependence upon the barons; but the rest of the
nation was favoured also in some degree in order that it might
range itself on the side of its professed protectors. The power of
the nobility was undermined by Henry VII., and the later kings have
been wont to create new peers from time to time with the idea of
preserving the order of the peerage which they formerly feared so
profoundly, and counterbalancing the steadily-growing strength of
the Commons.</p>

<p>A man is not, in this country, exempt from certain taxes because
he is a noble or a priest; all taxation is controlled by the House
of Commons, which, although second in rank, is first in power.</p>

<p>The House of Lords may reject the bill of the Commons<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
for taxation; but it may not amend it; the Lords must either reject
it or accept it entire. When the bill is confirmed by the Lords and
approved by the King, then everybody pays&mdash;not according to
his quality (which is absurd), but according to his revenue. There
are no poll-taxes or other arbitrary levies, but a land tax, which
remains the same, even although the revenues from lands increase,
so that nobody suffers extortion, and nobody complains. The
peasant's feet are not tortured by sabots; he eats white bread; he
dresses well; he need not hesitate to increase his stock or tile
his roof, for fear that next year he will have to submit to new
exactions by the tax-gatherer.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Commerce</i></div>

<p>Commerce, which has enriched the citizens in England, has
contributed to make them free, and freedom has in its turn extended
commerce. Thereby has been erected the greatness of the State. It
is commerce which has gradually established the naval forces
through which the English are masters of the sea.</p>

<p>An English merchant is quite justly proud of himself and his
occupation; he likes to compare himself, not without some warrant,
with a Roman citizen. The younger sons of noblemen do not despise a
business career. Lord Townsend, a Minister of State, has a brother
who is content to be a city merchant. When Lord Oxford governed
England, his younger son was a commercial agent at Aleppo, whence
he refused to return, and where some years ago he died.</p>

<p>This custom, which is unfortunately dying out, would seem
monstrous to German grandees with quarterings on the brain. In
Germany they are all princes; they cannot conceive that the son of
a Peer of England would lower himself to be a rich and powerful
citizen. There have been in Germany nearly thirty highnesses of
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">
282</a></span> same name, not one of them with a scrap of property
beyond his coat of arms and his pride.</p>

<p>In France, anybody who likes may be a marquis, and whosoever
arrives from the corner of some province, with money to spend and a
name ending with Ac or Ille, may say, "a man such as I, a man of my
quality," and may show sovereign contempt for a mere merchant. The
merchant so often hears his occupation spoken of with disdain that
he is fool enough to blush for it. Yet I cannot tell which is the
more valuable to the State&mdash;a well-powdered lordling, who
knows precisely at what hour the king rises, and at what hour he
goes to bed, and who assumes airs of loftiness when playing the
slave in a minister's ante-chamber; or a merchant who enriches his
country, issues from his office orders to Surat and Cairo, and
contributes to the happiness of the world.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;Tragedy and Comedy</i></div>

<p>The drama of England, like that of Spain, was fully grown when
the French drama was in a state of childishness. Shakespeare, who
is accounted to be the English Corneille, flourished at about the
same time as Lope de Vega; and it was Shakespeare who created the
English drama. He possessed a fertile and powerful genius, that had
within its scope both the normal and the sublime; but he ignored
rules entirely, and had not the smallest spark of good taste. It is
a risky thing to say, but true nevertheless&mdash;this author has
ruined the English drama. In these monstrous farces of his, called
tragedies, there are scenes so beautiful, fragments so impressive
and terrible, that the pieces have always been played with immense
success. Time, which alone makes the reputation of men, ultimately
condones their defects. Most of the fantastic and colossal
creations of this author have with the lapse of two centuries
established a claim to be considered sublime; most of the
modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">
283</a></span> authors have copied him; but where Shakespeare is
applauded, they are hissed, and you can believe that the veneration
in which the old author is held increases proportionately to the
contempt for the new ones. It is not considered that he should not
be copied; the failure of his imitators only leads to his being
thought inimitable. You are aware that in the tragedy of the Moor
of Venice, a very touching piece, a husband smothers his wife on
the stage, and that when the poor woman is being smothered, she
cries out that she is unjustly slain. You know that in "Hamlet" the
grave-diggers drink, and sing catches while digging a grave, and
joke about the skulls they come across in a manner suited to the
class of men who do such work. But it will surprise you to learn
that these vulgarities were imitated during the reign of Charles
II.&mdash;the heyday of polite manners, the golden age of the fine
arts.</p>

<p>The first Englishman to write a really sane tragic piece,
elegant from beginning to end, was the illustrious Mr. Addison. His
"Cato in Utica" is a masterpiece in diction and in beauty of verse.
Cato himself seems to me the finest character in any drama; but the
others are far inferior to him, and the piece is disfigured by a
most unconvincing love-intrigue which inflicts a weariness that
kills the play. The custom of dragging in a superfluous love-affair
came from Paris to London, along with our ribbons and our wigs,
about 1660. The ladies who adorn the theatres with their presence
insist upon hearing of nothing but love. The wise Addison was weak
enough to bend the severity of his nature in compliance with the
manners of his time; he spoilt a masterpiece through simple desire
to please.</p>

<p>Since "Cato," dramas have become more regular, audiences more
exacting, authors more correct and less daring. I have seen some
new plays that are judicious, but uninspiring. It would seem that
the English, so far, have only been meant to produce irregular
beauties. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id=
"Page_284">284</a></span> brilliant monstrosities of
Shakespeare please a thousand times more than discreet modern
productions. The poetic genius of the English, up to now, resembles
a gnarled tree planted by nature, casting out branches right and
left, growing unequally and forcefully; seek to shape it into the
trim likeness of the trees of the garden at Marly, and it
perishes.</p>

<p>The man who has carried farthest the glory of the English comic
stage is Mr. Congreve. He has written few pieces, but all excellent
of their kind. The rules are carefully observed, and the plays are
full of characters shaded with extreme delicacy. Mr. Congreve was
infirm and almost dying when I met him. He had one fault&mdash;that
of looking down upon the profession which had brought him fame and
fortune. He spoke of his works to me as trifles beneath his notice,
and asked me to regard him simply as a private gentleman who lived
very plainly. I replied that if he had had the misfortune to be
merely a private gentleman like anybody else, I should never have
gone to see him. His ill-placed vanity disgusted me.</p>

<p>His comedies, however, are the neatest and choicest on the
English stage; Vanbrugh's are the liveliest, and Wycherley's the
most vigorous.</p>

<p>Do not ask me to give details of these English comedies that I
admire so keenly; laughter cannot be communicated in a translation.
If you wish to know English comedy, there is nothing for it but to
go to London for three years, learn English thoroughly, and see a
comedy every day.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with tragedy; tragedy is concerned with great
passions and heroic follies consecrated by ancient errors in fable
and history. Electra belongs to the Spaniards, to the English, and
to ourselves as much as to the Greeks; but comedy is the living
portraiture of a nation's absurdities, and unless you know the
nation through and through, it is not for you to judge the
portraits.</p>

<h4>ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE</h4>

<h4>Travels on the Amazon</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;First View</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Alfred Russel Wallace, eminent as traveller, author, and
naturalist, was born January 8, 1822, at Usk, in Wales. Till 1845
he followed as an architect and land-surveyor the profession for
which he had been trained, but after that time he engaged
assiduously in natural history researches. With Mr. Bates, the
noted traveller and explorer and writer, he spent four years in the
romantic regions of the Amazon basin, and next went to the Malay
Islands, where he remained for eight years, making collections of
geological specimens. It is one of the most remarkable coincidences
in human experience that Wallace and Darwin simultaneously and
without mutual understanding of any kind achieved the discovery of
the law of natural selection and the evolution hypothesis by which
biological science has been completely revolutionized. This
absolutely independent accomplishment by two scientists amazed them
as well as the whole scientific world. The voluminous works of this
author, besides the record of his Amazon expedition, include his
"Malay Archipelago," "Contributions to the Theory of Natural
Selection," "Miracles and Spiritualism," "The Geographical
Distribution of Animals," "Tropical Nature," "Australasia," "Island
Life," "Land Nationalisation," "Darwinism," and "Man's Place in the
Universe."</p>
</div>

<p>It was on the morning of the 26th of May, 1848, that after a
short passage of twenty-nine days from Liverpool, we came to anchor
opposite the southern entrance to the River Amazon, and obtained a
first view of South America. In the afternoon the pilot came on
board, and the next morning we sailed with a fair wind up the
river, which for fifty miles could only be distinguished from the
ocean by its calmness and discoloured water, the northern shore
being invisible, and the southern at a distance of ten or twelve
miles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">
286</a></span> Early on the morning of the 28th we again anchored;
and when the sun arose in a cloudless sky, the city of Par&aacute;,
surrounded by a dense forest, and overtopped by palms and
plantains, greeted our sight, appearing doubly beautiful from the
presence of those luxuriant tropical productions in a state of
nature, which we had so often admired in the conservatories of Kew
and Chatsworth.</p>

<p>The canoes passing with their motley crews of Negroes and
Indians, the vultures soaring overhead or walking lazily on the
beach, and the crowds of swallows on the churches and housetops,
all served to occupy our attention till the custom-house officers
visited us, and we were allowed to go on shore. Par&aacute;
contains about 15,000 inhabitants and does not occupy a great
extent of ground; yet it is the largest city on the greatest river
in the world, the Amazon, and is the capital of a province equal in
extent to all western Europe. We proceeded to the house of the
consignee of our vessel, Mr. Miller, by whom we were most kindly
received and accommodated in his "rosinha," or suburban villa.</p>

<p>We hired an old Negro man named Isidora for a cook, and
regularly commenced housekeeping, learning Portuguese, and
investigating the natural productions of the country. Having
arrived at Par&aacute; at the end of the wet season, we did not at
first see all the glories of the vegetation. The beauty of the
palm-trees can scarcely be too highly drawn. In the forest a few
miles out of the town trees of enormous height, of various species,
rise on every side. Climbing and parasitic plants, with large
shining leaves, run up the trunks, while others, with fantastic
stems, hang like ropes and cables from their summits.</p>

<p>Most striking of all are the passion-flowers, purple, scarlet,
or pale pink; the purple ones have an exquisite perfume, and they
all produce an agreeable fruit, the grenadilla of the West Indies.
The immense number of orange-trees about the city is an interesting
feature, and renders that delicious fruit always abundant and
cheap.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">
287</a></span> The mango is also abundant, and on every roadside
the coffee-tree is seen growing, generally with flower or fruit,
often with both.</p>

<p>Turning our attention to the world of animal life, the lizards
first attract notice, for they abound everywhere, running along
walls and palings, sunning themselves on logs of wood, or creeping
up the eaves of the lower houses. The ants cannot fail to be
noticed. At meals they make themselves at home on the tablecloth,
in your plate, and in the sugar-basin.</p>

<p>At first we employed ourselves principally in collecting
insects, and in about three weeks I and Mr. B. had captured upwards
of 150 species of butterflies. The species seemed inexhaustible,
and the exquisite colouring and variety of marking is
wonderful.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Wonderful Forest</i></div>

<p>On the morning of June 23rd we started early to walk to the
rice-mills and wood-yard at Magoary, which we had been invited to
visit by the proprietor, Mr. Upton, and the manager, Mr. Leavens,
both American gentlemen. At about two miles from the city we
entered the virgin forest, where we saw giant trees covered to the
summit with parasites upon parasites. The herbage consisted for the
most part of ferns. At the wood-mills we saw the different kinds of
timber used, both in logs and boards.</p>

<p>What most interested us were large logs of the Masseranduba, or
milk-tree. On our way through the forest we had seen some trunks
much notched by persons who had been extracting the milk. It is one
of the noblest trees of the forest, rising with a straight stem to
an enormous height. The timber is very hard, durable, and valuable;
the fruit is very good and full of rich pulp; but strangest of all
is the vegetable milk which exudes in abundance when the bark is
cut. It is like thick cream, scarcely to be distinguished in
flavour from the product<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288"
id="Page_288">288</a></span> of the cow. Next morning some of
it was given to us in our tea at breakfast by Mr. Leavens. The milk
is also used for making excellent glue.</p>

<p>During our stay at the mills for several days to me the greatest
treat was making my first acquaintance with the monkeys. One
morning, when walking alone in the forest, I heard a rustling of
the leaves and branches. Looking up, I saw a large monkey staring
down at me, and seeming as much astonished as I was myself. He
speedily retreated. The next day, being out with Mr. Leavens, near
the same place, we heard a similar sound, and it soon became
evident that a whole troop of monkeys was approaching.</p>

<p>We hid ourselves under some trees and with guns cocked awaited
their coming. Presently we caught sight of them skipping from tree
to tree with the greatest ease, and at last one approached too near
for its safety, for Mr. Leavens fired and it fell. Having often
heard how good monkey was, I took it home and had it cut up and
fried for breakfast. There was about as much of it as a fowl, and
the meat something resembled rabbit, without any peculiar or
unpleasant flavour.</p>

<p>On August 3rd we received a fresh inmate into our veranda in the
person of a fine young boa constrictor. A man who had caught it in
the forest left it for our inspection. It was about ten feet long,
and very large, being as thick as a man's thigh. Here it lay
writhing about for two or three days, dragging its clog along with
it, sometimes stretching its mouth open with a most suspicious
yawn, and twisting up the end of its tail into a very tight curl.
We purchased it of its captor for 4s. 6d. and got him to put it
into a cage which we constructed. It immediately began to make up
for lost time by breathing most violently, the expirations sounding
like high-pressure steam escaping from a Great Western locomotive.
This it continued for some hours and then settled down into silence
which it maintained unless when disturbed<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span> or irritated.
Though it was without food for more than a week, the birds we gave
it were refused, even when alive. Rats are said to be their
favourite food, but these we could not procure.</p>

<p>Another interesting little animal was a young sloth, which
Antonio, an Indian boy, brought alive from the forest. It could
scarcely crawl along the ground, but appeared quite at home on a
chair, hanging on the back, legs, or rail.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;On the Par&aacute;
Tributary</i></div>

<p>On the afternoon of August 26th we left Par&aacute; for the
Tocantins. Mr. Leavens had undertaken to arrange all the details of
the voyage. He had hired one of the roughly made but convenient
country canoes, having a tolda, or palm-thatched roof, like a
gipsy's tent, over the stern, which formed our cabin. The canoe had
two masts and fore and aft sails, and was about 24 feet long and
eight wide.</p>

<p>Besides our guns, ammunition and boxes for our collections, we
had a stock of provisions for three months. Our crew consisted of
old Isidora, as cook; Alexander, an Indian from the mills, who was
named Captain; Domingo, who had been up the river, and was
therefore to be our pilot; and Antonio, the boy before
mentioned.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the city night came on, and the tide running
against us, we had to anchor. We were up at five the next morning,
and found that we were in the Moj&uacute;, up which our way lay,
and which enters the Par&aacute; river from the south. We
breakfasted on board, and about two in the afternoon reached
Jighery, a very pretty spot, with steep grassy banks, cocoa and
other palms, and oranges in profusion. Here we stayed for the tide,
and I and Mr. B. went in search of insects, which we found to be
rather abundant, and immediately took two species of butterflies we
had never seen at Par&aacute;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>Our men had caught a sloth in the morning, as it was swimming
across the river, which was about half a mile wide. It was
different from the species we had alive at Par&aacute;, having a
patch of short yellow and black fur on the back. The Indians stewed
it for their dinner, and as they consider the meat a great
delicacy, I tasted it, and found it tender and very palatable. In
the evening the scene was lovely. The groups of elegant palms, the
large cotton-trees, relieved against the golden sky, the Negro
houses surrounded with orange and mango trees, the grassy bank, the
noble river, and the background of eternal forest, all softened by
the mellowed light of the magical half-hour after sunset formed a
picture indescribably beautiful.</p>

<p>Returning to Par&aacute; we remained there till November 3rd,
when we left for the island of Mexiana, situated in the main stream
of the Amazon, between the great island of Maraj&oacute;, and the
northern shore. We had to go down the Par&aacute; river, and round
the eastern point of Maraj&oacute;, where we were quite exposed to
the ocean; and, though most of the time in fresh water, I was very
seasick all the voyage, which lasted four days.</p>

<p>The island of Mexiana is about 25 miles long by 12 broad, of a
regular oval shape, and is situated exactly on the equator. It is
celebrated for its birds, alligators, and oncas, and is used as a
cattle estate by the proprietor. The alligators abound in a lake in
the centre of the island, where they are killed in great numbers
for their fat, which is made into oil.</p>

<p>On inquiring about the best localities for insects, birds, and
plants, we were rather alarmed by being told that oncas were very
numerous, even near the house, and that it was dangerous to walk
out alone or unarmed. We soon found, however, that no one had been
actually attacked by them; though they, poor animals, are by no
means unmolested, as numerous handsome skins drying in the sun, and
teeth and skulls lying about, sufficiently proved.</p>

<p><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>Light-coloured, long-tailed cuckoos were continually flying
about. Equally abundant are the hornbill cuckoos, and on almost
every tree may be seen sitting a hawk or a buzzard. Pretty
parroquets, with white and orange bands on their wings, were very
plentiful. Then among the bushes there were flocks of the
red-breasted oriole. The common black vulture is generally to be
seen sailing overhead, the great Muscovy ducks fly past with a
rushing sound, offering a striking contrast to the great wood-ibis,
which sails along with noiseless wings in flocks of ten or a
dozen.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;Continuing Upstream</i></div>

<p>We now prepared for our voyage up the Amazon; and, from
information we obtained of the country, determined first to go as
far as Santarem, a town about 500 miles up the river, and the seat
of considerable trade. We sailed up a fine stream till we entered
among islands, and soon got into the narrow channel which forms the
communication between the Par&aacute; and Amazon rivers.</p>

<p>We proceeded for several days in those narrow channels, which
form a network of water, a labyrinth quite unknown, except to the
inhabitants of the district. It was about ten days after we left
Par&aacute; that the stream began to widen out and the tide to flow
into the Amazon instead of into the Par&aacute; river, giving us
the longer ebb to make way with. In about two days more we were in
the Amazon itself, and it was with emotions of admiration and awe
that we gazed upon the stream of this mighty and far-famed river.
What a grand idea it was to think that we now saw the accumulated
waters of a course of 3,000 miles. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru, Bolivia, and Brazil, six mighty states, spreading over a
country far larger than Europe, had each contributed to form the
flood which bore us so peacefully on its bosom.</p>

<p>The most striking features of the Amazon are its vast<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">
292</a></span> expanse of smooth water, generally from three to
six miles wide; its pale, yellowish-olive colour; the great beds of
aquatic grass which line its shores, large masses of which are
often detached and form floating islands; the quantity of fruits
and leaves and great trunks of trees which it carries down, and its
level banks clad with lofty unbroken forest.</p>

<p>There is much animation, too, on this giant stream. Numerous
flocks of parrots, and the great red and yellow macaws, fly across
every morning and evening, uttering their hoarse cries. Many kinds
of herons and rails frequent the marshes on its banks; but perhaps
the most characteristic birds of the Amazon are the gulls and
terns, which are in great abundance. Besides these there are divers
and darters in immense numbers. Porpoises are constantly blowing in
every direction, and alligators are often seen slowly swimming
across the river.</p>

<p>At length, after a prolonged voyage of 28 days, we reached
Santarem, at the mouth of the river Tapajoz, whose blue,
transparent waters formed a most pleasing contrast to the turbid
stream of the Amazon. We stayed at Santarem during September,
October, and November, working hard till three in the afternoon
each day, generally collecting some new and interesting insects in
the forest. Here was the haunt of the beautiful "Callithea
sapphirs," one of the most lovely of butterflies, and of numerous
brilliant little "Erycinid&aelig;."</p>

<p>The constant exercise, pure air, and good living,
notwithstanding the intense heat, kept us in the most perfect
health, and I have never altogether enjoyed myself so much.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;The City of Barra</i></div>

<p>On December 31, 1849, we arrived at the city of Barra on the Rio
Negro. It is situated on the east bank of that tributary, about
twelve miles above its junction with the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span> Amazon. The trade
is chiefly in Brazil nuts, sarsaparilla, and fish. The distance up
the Amazon from Par&aacute; to Barra is about 1,000 miles. The
voyage often occupies from two to three months. The more civilized
inhabitants of the city are all engaged in trade, and have
literally no amusements whatever, unless drinking and gambling on a
small scale can be so considered: most of them never open a book,
or have any mental occupation.</p>

<p>The Rio Negro well deserves its name&mdash;"inky black." For its
waters, where deep, are of dense blackness. There are striking
differences between this river and the Amazon. Here are no islands
of floating grass, no logs and uprooted trees, with their cargoes
of gulls, scarcely any stream, and few signs of life in the black
and sluggish waters. Yet when there is a storm, there are greater
and more dangerous waves than on the Amazon. At Barra the Rio Negro
is a mile and a half wide. A few miles up it widens considerably,
in many places forming deep bays eight or ten miles across.</p>

<p>In this region are found the umbrella birds. One evening a
specimen was brought me by a hunter. This singular bird is about
the size of a raven. On its head it bears a crest, different from
that of any other bird. It can be laid back so as to be hardly
visible, or can be erected and spread out on every side, forming a
hemispherical dome, completely covering the head. In a month I
obtained 25 specimens of the umbrella bird.</p>

<p>The river Uaup&eacute;s is a tributary of the Upper Rio Negro,
and a voyage up this stream brought us into singular regions. Our
canoe was worked by Indians. In one of the Indian villages we
witnessed a grand snake dance. The dancers were entirely unclad,
but were painted in all kinds of curious designs, and the male
performers wear on the top of the head a fine broad plume of the
tail-coverts of the white egret. The Indians keep these noble birds
in great open houses or cages; but as the birds are rare, and the
young with difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id=
"Page_294">294</a></span> secured, the ornament is one that
few possess. Cords of monkeys' hair, decorated with small feathers,
hang down the back, and in the ears are the little downy plumes,
forming altogether a most imposing and elegant headdress.</p>

<p>The paint with which both men and women decorate their bodies
has a very neat effect, and gives them almost the aspect of being
dressed, and as such they seem to regard it. The dancers had made
two huge artificial snakes of twigs and branches bound together,
from thirty to forty feet long and a foot in diameter, painted a
bright red colour. This made altogether a very formidable looking
animal. They divided themselves into two parties of about a dozen
each and, lifting the snake on their shoulders, began dancing.</p>

<p>In the dance they imitated the undulations of the serpent,
raising the head and twisting the tail. In the man&oelig;uvres which
followed, the two great snakes seemed to fight, till the dance,
which had greatly pleased all the spectators, was concluded.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VI.&mdash;Devil-Music</i></div>

<p>In another village I first saw and heard the "Juripari", or
devil-music of the Indians. One evening there was a drinking-feast;
and a little before dusk a sound as of trombones and bassoons was
heard coming on the river towards the village, and presently
appeared eight Indians, each playing on a great bassoon-looking
instrument, made of bark spirally twisted, and with a mouthpiece of
leaves. The sound produced is wild and pleasing.</p>

<p>The players waved their instruments about in a singular manner,
accompanied by corresponding contortions of the body. From the
moment the music was first heard, not a female, old or young, was
to be seen; for it is one of the strangest superstitions of the
Uaup&eacute;s Indians, that they consider it so dangerous for a
woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">
295</a></span> ever to see one of these instruments, that, having
done so, she is punished with death, generally by poison.</p>

<p>Even should the view be perfectly accidental, or should there be
only a suspicion that the proscribed articles have been seen, no
mercy is shown; and it is said that fathers have been the
executioners of their own daughters, and husbands of their wives,
when such has been the case.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VII.&mdash;The World's Greatest River
Basin</i></div>

<p>The basin of the Amazon surpasses in dimensions that of any
other river in the world. It is entirely situated in the tropics,
on both sides of the equator, and receives over its whole extent
the most abundant rains. The body of fresh water emptied by it into
the ocean is, therefore, far greater than that of any other river.
For richness of vegetable productions and universal fertility of
soil it is unequalled on the globe.</p>

<p>The whole area of this wonderful region is 2,330,000 square
miles. This is more than a third of all South America, and equal to
two-thirds of all Europe. All western Europe could be placed within
its basin, without touching its boundaries, and it would even
contain our whole Indian empire.</p>

<p>Perhaps no country in the world contains such an amount of
vegetable matter on its surface as the valley of the Amazon. Its
entire extent, with the exception of some very small portions, is
covered with one dense and lofty primeval forest, the most
extensive and unbroken which exists on the earth. It is the great
feature of the country&mdash;that which at once stamps it as a
unique and peculiar region. Here we may travel for weeks and months
in any direction, and scarcely find an acre of ground unoccupied by
trees. The forests of the Amazon are distinguished from those of
most other countries by the great variety of species of trees
composing them. Instead of extensive tracts covered with pines, or
oaks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">
296</a></span> or beeches, we scarcely ever see two individuals of
the same species together.</p>

<p>The Brazil nuts are brought chiefly from the interior; the
greater part from the country around the junction of the Rio Negro
and Madeira with the Amazon. The tree takes more than a year to
produce and ripen its fruits, which, as large and as heavy as
cannon balls, fall with tremendous force from the height of a
hundred feet, crashing through the branches and undergrowth, and
snapping off large boughs. Persons are sometimes killed by
them.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VIII.&mdash;Splendid Native Races</i></div>

<p>Comparing the accounts given by other travellers with my own
observations, the Indians of the Amazon valley appear to be much
superior, both physically and intellectually, to those of South
Brazil and of most other parts of South America. They more closely
resemble the intelligent and noble races inhabiting the western
prairies of North America.</p>

<p>I do not remember a single circumstance in my travels so
striking and so new, or that so well fulfilled all previous
expectations, as my first view of the real uncivilised inhabitants
of the Uaup&eacute;s. I felt that I was in the midst of something
new and startling, as if I had been instantaneously transported to
a distant and unknown country.</p>

<p>The Indians of the Amazon and its tributaries are of a countless
variety of tribes and nations; all of whom have peculiar languages
and customs, and many of them some distinct characteristics. In
many individuals of both sexes the most perfect regularity of
features exists, and there are numbers who in colour alone differ
from a good-looking European.</p>

<p>Their figures are generally superb; and I have never felt so
much pleasure in gazing at the finest statue, as at these living
illustrations of the beauty of the human<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span> form. The
development of the chest is such as I believe never exists in the
best-formed European, exhibiting a splendid series of convex
undulations, without a hollow in any part of it.</p>

<p>Among the tribes of the Uaup&eacute;s the men have the hair
carefully parted and combed on each side, and tied in a queue
behind. In the young men, it hangs in long locks down their necks,
and, with the comb, which is invariably carried stuck in the top of
the head, gives to them a most feminine appearance. This is
increased by the large necklaces and bracelets of beads, and the
careful extirpation of every symptom of beard.</p>

<p>Taking these circumstances into consideration, I am strongly of
opinion that the story of the Amazons has arisen from these
feminine-looking warriors encountered by the early voyagers. I am
inclined to this opinion, from the effect they first produced on
myself, when it was only by close examination I saw that they were
men.</p>

<p>I cannot make out that these Indians of the Amazon have any
belief that can be called a religion. They appear to have no
definite idea of a God. If asked who made the rivers and the
forests and the sky, they will reply that they do not know, or
sometimes that they suppose it was "Tupanau," a word that appears
to answer to God, but of which they understand nothing. They have
much more definite ideas of a bad spirit, "Jurupari," or Devil,
whom they fear, and endeavour through their "pag&eacute;s," or
sorcerers, to propitiate.</p>

<p>When it thunders, they say that the "Jurupari" is angry, and
their idea of natural death is that the "Jurupari" kills them. At
an eclipse they believe that this bad spirit is killing the moon,
and they make all the noise they can to drive him away. One of the
singular facts connected with these Indians of the Amazon valley is
the resemblance between some of their customs and those of the
nations most remote from them. The gravatana, or blowpipe,
reappears in the sumpitan of Borneo;<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span> the great houses of
the Uaup&eacute;s closely resemble those of the Dyaks of the same
country; while many small baskets and bamboo-boxes from Borneo and
New Guinea are so similar in their form and construction to those
of the Amazon, that they would be supposed to belong to adjoining
tribes.</p>

<p>The main feature in the personal character of the Indians of
this part of South America is a degree of diffidence, bashfulness,
or coldness, which affects all their actions. It is this that
produces their quiet deliberation, their circuitous way of
introducing a subject they have come to speak about, talking half
an hour on different topics before mentioning it. Owing to this
feeling, they will run away if displeased rather than complain, and
will never refuse to undertake what is asked them, even when they
are unable or do not intend to perform it. They scarcely ever
quarrel among themselves, work hard, and submit willingly to
authority. They are ingenious and skilful workmen and readily adopt
any customs of civilised life introduced among them.</p>

<h4>ELIOT WARBURTON</h4>

<h4>The Crescent and the Cross</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;Alexandria</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Bartholomew Eliot George Warburton, who wrote as Eliot
Warburton, was born in 1810 in Tullamore, Ireland, and died in
1852. He graduated at Cambridge, where he was the fellow student
and intimate friend of Hallam, Monckton Milnes, and Kinglake (of
"Eothen" fame). He studied law and was called to the bar, but
instead of practising in the legal profession took to a most
adventurous career of travel, and wrote of his experiences in a
spirited and romantic style which soon secured him a wide
reputation. His eight works include "The Crescent and the Cross,"
which appeared in 1845, after his wanderings in Egypt, Syria,
Turkey, and Greece; "Memoirs of Prince Rupert," and "Darien, or the
Merchant Prince." He was sailing for Panama, as an agent of the
Atlantic and Pacific Company, when he was lost in the steamship
Amazon, which was burnt off Land's End on January 4, 1852.
Warburton was beloved for his generous, amiable, and chivalrous
disposition. His peculiar gift for embodying in graphic terms his
appreciation of striking scenery and his picturesque delineation of
foreign manners and customs give his works a permanent place in the
classics of travel.</p>
</div>

<p>We took leave of Old England and the Old Year together. On the
first of January we left Southampton; on the evening of the 2nd we
took leave of England at Falmouth. Towards evening, on the 18th day
since leaving England, the low land of Egypt was visible from the
mast-head. The only object visible from the decks was a faint speck
on the horizon, but that speck was Pompey's Pillar. This is the
site Alexander selected from his wide dominions, and which Napoleon
pronounced to be unrivalled in importance. Here stood the great
library of antiquity, and here the Hebrew Scriptures expanded into
Greek under the hands of the Septuagint. Here Cleopatra revelled
with her Roman conquerors. Here St. Mark preached the truth on
which Origen attempted to refine, and here Athanasius held warlike
controversy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">
300</a></span> The bay is crowded with merchant vessels of every
nation. Men-of-war barges shoot past you with crews dressed in what
look like red nightcaps and white petticoats. Here, an "ocean
patriarch" (as the Arabs call Noah), with white turban and flowing
beard, is steering a little ark filled with unclean-looking animals
of every description; and there, a crew of swarthy Egyptians, naked
from the waist upwards, are pulling some pale-faced strangers to a
vessel with loosed top.</p>

<p>The crumbling quays are piled with bales of eastern merchandise,
islanded in a sea of white turbans wreathed over dark, melancholy
faces. High above the variegated crowds peer the long necks of
hopeless-looking camels. Passing through the Arab city, you emerge
into the Frank quarter, a handsome square of tall white houses,
over which the flags of every nation in Europe denote the
residences of the various consuls. In this square is an endless
variety of races and costumes most picturesquely grouped together,
and lighted brilliantly by a glowing sun in a cloudless sky. In one
place, a procession of women waddles along, wrapped in large
shroud-like veils from head to foot. In another, a group of Turks
in long flowing drapery are seated in a circle smoking their
chiboukes in silence.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;The Nile</i></div>

<p>"Egypt is the gift of the Nile," said one who was bewildered by
its antiquity before our history was born (at least he, Herodotus,
was called the father of it). This is an exotic land. That river,
winding like a serpent through its paradise, has brought it from
far regions. Those quiet plains have tumbled down the cataracts;
those demure gardens have flirted with the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span> Isle of Flowers
(Elephantina), five hundred miles away; and those very pyramids
have floated down the waves of Nile. In short, to speak chemically,
that river is a solution of Ethiopia's richest regions, and that
vast country is merely a precipitate.</p>

<p>Arrived at Alexandria, the traveller is yet far distant from the
Nile. The Canopic mouth is long since closed up by the mud of
Ethiopia, and the Arab conquerors of Egypt were obliged to form a
canal to connect this seaport with the river. Under the Mamelukes,
this canal had also become choked up. When Mehemet Ali rose to
power his clear intellect at once comprehended the importance of
the ancient emporium. Alexandria was then become a mere harbour for
pirates. The desert and the sea were gradually encroaching on its
boundaries, but the Pasha ordered the desert to bring forth corn
and the sea to retire. Up rose a stately city of 60,000
inhabitants, and as suddenly yawned the canal which was to connect
the new city with the Nile.</p>

<p>In the greatness and cruelty of its accomplishment, this
Mahmoudie canal may vie with the gigantic labours of the Pharaohs.
From the villages of the delta were swept 250,000 men, women, and
children, and heaped like a ridge along the banks of the fatal
canal. They had only provisions for a month, and famine soon made
its appearance. It was a fearful sight to see the multitude
convulsively working against time. As a dying horse bites the
ground in his agony, they tore up that great grave&mdash;25,000
people perished, but the grim contract was completed, and in six
weeks the waters of the Nile were led to Alexandria.</p>

<p>It was midnight when we arrived at Atfeh, the point of junction
with the Nile. We are now on the sacred river. In some hours we
emerged from the Rosetta branch and the prospect began to improve.
Villages sheltered by graceful groups of palm-trees, mosques, green
plains, and at length the desert&mdash;the most imposing<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">
302</a></span> sight in the world, except the sea. We felt we were
actually in Egypt and our spirits rose. By the time the evening and
the mist had rendered the country invisible, we had persuaded
ourselves that Egypt was indeed the lovely land that Moore has so
delightfully imagined in the pages of the "Epicurean."</p>

<div class="center"><i>III&mdash;Cairo and Heliopolis</i></div>

<p>Morning found us anchored off Boulak, the port of Cairo. Toward
the river it is faced by factories and storehouses; within, you
find yourself in a labyrinth of brown, narrow streets, that
resemble rather rifts in some mud mountain, than anything with
which architecture has had to do. Yet here and there the blankness
of the walls is relieved and broken by richly worked lattices, and
specimens of arabesque masonry.</p>

<p>Gaudy bazaars strike the eye, and the picturesque population
that swarms everywhere keeps the interest awake. On emerging from
the lanes of Boulak, Cairo, Grand Cairo! opens on the view; and
never did fancy flash upon the poet's eye a more superb illusion of
power and beauty than the "city of Victory" presents from a
distance. ("El Kahira," the Arabic epithet of this city, means "the
Victorious.") The bold range of the Mokattam mountains is purpled
by the rising sun, its craggy summits are clearly cut against the
glowing sky, it runs like a promontory into a sea of verdure, here
wavy with a breezy plantation of olives, there darkened with
accacia groves.</p>

<p>Just where the mountain sinks upon the plain, the citadel stands
upon its last eminence, and widely spread beneath it lies the city,
a forest of minarets with palm-trees intermingled, and the domes of
innumerable mosques rising, like enormous bubbles, over the sea of
houses. Here and there, richly green gardens are islanded within
that sea, and the whole is girt round with<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span> picturesque
towers and ramparts, occasionally revealed through vistas of the
wood of sycamores and fig-trees that surround it. It has been said
that "God the first garden made, and the first city Cain," but here
they seem commingled with the happiest effect.</p>

<p>The objects of interest in the neighbourhood of Cairo are very
numerous. Let us first canter off to Heliopolis, the On of
Scripture. It is only five miles of a pathway, shaded by sycamore
and plane-trees, from which we emerge occasionally into green
savannahs or luxuriant cornfields, over which the beautiful white
ibis are hovering in flocks.</p>

<p>In Heliopolis, the Oxford of Old Egypt, stood the great Temple
of the Sun. Here the beautiful and the wise studied love and logic
4,000 years ago. Here Joseph was married to the fair Asenath. Here
Plato and Herodotus studied and here the darkness which veiled the
Great Sacrifice was observed by a heathen astronomer, Dionysius the
Areopagite. We found nothing, however, on the site of this ancient
city, except a small garden of orange-trees, with a magnificent
obelisk in the centre.</p>

<div class="center"><i>IV.&mdash;The Market of Sorrow</i></div>

<p>One day while in Cairo I went to visit the slave-markets, one of
which is held without the city, in the courtyard of a deserted
mosque. I was received by a mild-looking Nubian, who led me in
silence to inspect his stock. I found about thirty girls scattered
in groups about an inner court. The gate was open, but there seemed
no thought of escape. Where could they go, poor things? Some were
grinding millet between two stones; some were kneading flour into
bread; some were chatting in the sunshine; some sleeping in the
shade.</p>

<p>One or two looked sad and lonely enough, until their gloomy
countenances were lit up with hope&mdash;the hope of being bought!
Their faces for the most part were<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span> woefully blank, and
many wore an awfully animal expression. Yet there were several
figures of exquisite symmetry among them, which, had they been
indeed the bronze statues they resembled, would have attracted the
admiration of thousands, and would have been valued at twenty times
the price that was set on these immortal beings. Their proprietor
showed them off as a horse-dealer does his cattle, examining their
teeth, removing their body-clothes, and exhibiting their paces.</p>

<p>It is like the change from night to morning, to pass from these
dingy crowds to the white slaves from Georgia and Circassia. The
commodities of this department of the human bazaars are only
purchased by wealthy and powerful Moslems; and, when purchased, are
destined to form part of the female aristocracy of Cairo. These
fetch from one, two, three, or even five hundred pounds, and being
so much more valuable than the Africans, are much more carefully
tended. Some were smoking; some chatting merrily together; some
sitting in dreamy languor. All their attitudes were very
graceful.</p>

<p>They were for the most part exquisitely fair; but I was
disappointed in their beauty. The sunny hair and heaven-blue eyes,
that in England produce such an angel-like and intellectual effect,
seemed to me here mere flax and beads; and I left them to the
"turbaned Turk" without a sigh.</p>

<div class="center"><i>V.&mdash;The Harem</i></div>

<p>Difficult a study as woman presents in all countries, that
difficulty deepens almost into impossibility in a land where even
to look upon her is a matter of danger or of death. The seclusion
of the hareem is preserved in the very streets by means of an
impenetrable veil; the well-bred Egyptian averts his eyes as she
passes by; she is ever to remain an object of mystery; and the most
intimate acquaintance never inquires after the wife of his friend,
or affects to know of her existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>An English lady, visiting an Odalisque, inquired what pleasure
her profusion of rich ornaments could afford, as no person except
her husband was ever to behold them. "And for whom do <i>you</i>
adorn yourself? Is it for other men?" replied the fair
barbarian.</p>

<p>I have conversed with several European ladies who had visited
hareems, and they have all confessed their inability to convince
the Eastern wives of the unhappiness or hardship of their state. It
is true that the inmate of the hareem knows nothing of the wild
liberty (as it seems to her) that the European woman enjoys. She
has never witnessed the domestic happiness that crowns a
fashionable life, or the peace of mind and purity of heart that
reward the labours of a London season. And what can <i>she</i> know
of the disinterested affection and changeless constancy of
ball-room belles, in the land where woman is all free?</p>

<p>Let them laugh on in their happy ignorance of a better lot,
while round them is gathered all that their lord can command of
luxury and pleasantness. His wealth is hoarded for them alone; he
permits himself no ostentation, except the respectable one of arms
and horses; and the time is weary that he passes apart from his
home and hareem. The sternest tyrants are gentle there; Mehemet Ali
never refused a woman's prayer; and even Ali Pasha was partly
humanized by his love for Emineh. In the time of the Mamelukes,
criminals were always led to execution blindfolded, as, if they had
met a woman and could touch her garment, they were saved, whatever
was their crime.</p>

<p>Thus idolized, watched, and guarded, the Egyptian woman's life
is, nevertheless, entirely in the power of her lord, and her death
is the inevitable penalty of his dishonour. Poor Fatima! shrined as
she was in the palace of a tyrant, the fame of her beauty stole
abroad through Cairo. She was one among a hundred in the hareem of
Abbas Pasha, a man stained with every foul<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span> and loathsome
vice; and who can wonder, though many may condemn, if she listened
to a daring young Albanian, who risked his life to obtain but a
sight of her. Whether she <i>did</i> listen or not, none can ever
know, but the eunuchs saw the glitter of the Arnaut's arms, as he
leaped from her terrace into the Nile and vanished into the
darkness.</p>

<p>The following night a merry English party dined together on
board Lord E&mdash;&mdash;'s boat, as it lay moored off the Isle
of Rhoda; conversation had sunk into silence as the calm night came
on; a faint breeze floated perfumes from the gardens over the
star-lit Nile; a dreamy languor seemed to pervade all nature, and
even the city lay hushed in deep repose, when suddenly a boat,
crowded with dark figures, among which arms gleamed, shot out from
one of the arches of the palace.</p>

<p>It paused under the opposite bank, where the water rushed deep
and gloomily along, and for a moment a white figure glimmered among
that boat's dark crew; there was a slight movement and a faint
splash, and then the river flowed on as merrily as if poor Fatima
still sang her Georgian song to the murmur of its waters.</p>

<p>I was riding one evening along the water-side. There was no
sound except the ripple of the waves and the heavy flapping of a
pelican's wing. As I paused to contemplate the scene an Egyptian
passed me hurriedly, with a bloody knife in his hand. His dress was
mean and ragged, but his countenance was one that the father of Don
Carlos might have worn. He never raised his eyes as he passed by;
and my groom, who just then came up, told me he had slain his wife,
and was going to her father's village to denounce her.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VI.&mdash;Djouni and Lady Hester
Stanhope</i></div>

<p>One morning we were already in motion as the sun rose over
Lebanon. We passed for some miles through mulberry gardens, and
over a dangerous rocky pass,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span> where Antiochus the
Great defeated the Egyptians, in 218 B.C. This pass would have
required the best exertions and courage of a European horse, yet a
file of camels was ascending it with the same patient look that
they wear in their native deserts. Though forced frequently to
traverse mountains in a country whose commerce is conducted by
their means, these animals are only at their ease upon the sandy
plain. The Arabs say, that if you were to ask a camel which he
preferred&mdash;travelling up or down hill, his answer would be,
"May the curse of Allah light on both!"</p>

<p>The road was only a steep and rocky path, which, in England, a
goat would be considered active if he could traverse. Our horses,
nevertheless, went along it at a canter, though the precipice
sometimes yawned beneath our outside stirrup, while the inner one
knocked fire out of the rocky cliff. Rocks, tumbled from the
mountain, lay strewn about and nearly choked up the narrow river
bed; over these we scrambled, climbed, and leaped in a manner that
only Arab horses would attempt or could accomplish.</p>

<p>It was late when we came in sight of two conical hills, on one
of which stands the village of Djouni, on the other a circular wall
over which dark trees were waving, and this was the place in which
Lady Hester Stanhope had finished her strange and eventful career.
It had been formerly a convent, but the Pasha of Acre had given it
to the "Prophet Lady," and she had converted its naked walls into
palaces, its wilderness into gardens. The sun was setting as we
entered the enclosure. The buildings that constituted the palace
were of a very scattered and complicated description, covering a
wide space, but only one storey in height; courts and gardens,
stables and sleeping-rooms, halls of audience and ladies' bowers,
were strangely intermingled.</p>

<p>Here fountains once played in marble basins, and choice flowers
bloomed; but now it presented a scene of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span> melancholy
desolation. Our dinner was spread on the floor in Lady Hester's
favourite apartment; her deathbed was our sideboard, her furniture
our fuel; her name our conversation. Lady Hester Stanhope was niece
to Mr. Pitt, and seems to have possessed or acquired something of
his indomitable energy and proud self-reliance during the time that
she presided over his household. Soon after his death she left
England. For some time she was at Constantinople, where her
magnificence and near alliance to the great minister gained her
considerable influence. Afterwards she passed into Syria.</p>

<p>Many of the people of that country, excited by the achievements
of Sir Sidney Smith, looked on her as a princess who had come to
prepare the way for the expected conquest of their land by the
English. Her influence increased through the prestige created by
her wealth and magnificence, as well as by her imperious character
and dauntless bravery. She believed in magic, astrology, and,
incredible as it may appear, in her own divine mission.</p>

<p>She had two mares which were held sacred by herself and her
attendants. One was singularly marked by a natural saddle. The
animal was never mounted, but reserved for some divinity whom she
was to accompany on his triumphant entry into Jerusalem. The other
was retained for her own "mount" on the same remarkable
occasion.</p>

<p>It is said that she was crowned Queen of the East by 50,000
Arabs, at Palmyra. Lady Hester certainly exercised despotic power
in her neighbourhood on the mountain. Mehemet Ali could make
nothing of her. She annihilated a village for disobedience, and
burned a mountain chalet, with all its inhabitants, on account of
the murder of two Frenchmen who were travelling under the
protection of her firman.</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309"
id="Page_309">309</a></span><i>VII.&mdash;Mount Hermon</i></div>

<p>One morning, before daylight, I set out for the summit of
Hermon, called in Arabic, Djebel Sheikh, the "Chief of the
Mountains." This is the highest point of Syria, the last of the
Anti-Lebanon range. We rode through some rugged valleys and tracts
of vineyards, and, leaving our horses at one of the sheds in the
latter, began the steep and laborious ascent. I have climbed
Snowdon, Vesuvius, Epomeo, and many others, but this was the
heaviest work of all. After six hours of toil we stood on the
summit, and perhaps the world does not afford a more magnificent
view than we then beheld.</p>

<p>We looked down from the ancient Hill of Hermon over the land of
Israel. There gleamed the bright blue Sea of Galilee, and nearer
was Lake Hooly, with Banias, the ancient Dan, on its banks. The
vast and varied plain, on which lay mapped a thousand places
familiar to the memory, was bounded on the right by the
Mediterranean, whose purple waters whitened round Sidon, Tyre, and
the distant Promontorium Album, over which just appeared the summit
of Mount Carmel. On the left of the plain a range of hills divided
the Hauran from Samaria. Further on, towards the Eastern horizon,
spread the plain of Damascus, and the desert towards Palmyra.</p>

<p>To the north, the wide and fertile valley of Bekaa lay between
the two great chains of the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon; the latter of
whose varied hills and glens, speckled with forests and villages,
lay beneath my feet. Nothing but lakes were wanting to the valleys,
nothing but heather to the mountains. We caught some goats after a
hard chase, and, milking them on the snow, drank eagerly from this
novel dairy.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards we discovered a little fountain gushing from a
snowy hill, and only those who have climbed<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span> a mountain 9,000
feet high, under a Syrian sun, can appreciate the luxury of such a
draught as that cool, bubbling rill afforded.</p>

<div class="center"><i>VIII.&mdash;Damascus: The World's Oldest
City</i></div>

<p>Emerging from the savage gorges of Anti-Lebanon, we entered a
wide, disheartening plain, bounded by an amphitheatre of dreary
mountains. Our horses had had no water for twenty-four hours, and
we had had no refreshment of any kind for twenty. After two hours
of more hard riding I came to another range of mountains, from
beyond which opened the view of Damascus, from which the Prophet
abstained as too delicious for a believer's gaze. It is said that
after many days of toilsome travel, when he beheld this city thus
lying at his feet, he exclaimed, "But one paradise is allowed to
man; I will not take mine in this world;" and so he turned his
horse's head from Damascus and pitched his tent in the desert.</p>

<p>For miles around us lay the dead desert, whose sands seemed to
quiver under the shower of sunbeams; far away to the south and east
it spread like a boundless ocean; but there, beneath our feet, lay
such an island of verdure as nowhere else perhaps exists. Mass upon
mass of dark, delicious foliage rolled like waves among garden
tracts of brilliant emerald green. Here and there the clustering
blossoms of the orange or the nectarine lay like foam upon that
verdant sea. Minarets, white as ivory, shot up their fairy towers
among the groves; and purple mosque-domes, tipped with the golden
crescent, gave the only sign that a city lay bowered beneath those
rich plantations.</p>

<p>One hour's gallop brought me to the suburban gates of
Mezz&eacute;, and thenceforth I rode on through streets, or rather
lanes, of pleasant shadow. For many an hour we had seen no water;
now it gushed and gleamed and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span> sparkled all around
us; from aqueduct above, and rivulet below, and marble fountain in
the walls&mdash;everywhere it poured forth its rich abundance; and
my horse and I soon quenched our burning thirst in Abana and
Pharphar.</p>

<p>On we went, among gardens, fountains, odours, and cool shade,
absorbed in sensations of delight. Fruits of every delicate shape
and hue bent the boughs hospitably over our heads; flowers hung in
canopy upon the trees and lay in variegated carpet on the ground;
the lanes through which we went were long arcades of arching
boughs; the walls were composed of large square blocks of dried
mud, which, in that bright, dazzling light somewhat resembled
Cyclopean architecture, and gave, I know not what, of simplicity
and primitiveness to the scene.</p>

<p>At length I entered the city, and thenceforth lost the sun while
I remained there. The luxurious people of Damascus exclude all
sunshine from their bazaars by awnings of thick mat, whenever
vine-trellises or vaulted roofs do not render this precaution
unnecessary. The effects of this pleasant gloom, the cool currents
of air created by the narrow streets, the vividness of the bazaars,
the variety and beauty of the Oriental dress, the fragrant smell of
the spice-shops, the tinkle of the brass cups of the sherbet
seller&mdash;all this affords a pleasant but bewildering change
from the silent desert and the glare of sunshine.</p>

<p>And then the glimpse of places strange to your eye, yet familiar
to your imagination, that you catch as you pass along. Here is the
portal of a large khan, with a fountain and cistern in the midst.
Camels and bales of merchandise and turbaned negroes are scattered
over its wide quadrangle, and an arcade of shops or offices
surrounds it, above and below, like the streets of Chester. Another
portal opens into a public bath, with its fountains, its
reservoirs, its gay carpets, and its luxurious<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
inmates clad in white linen and reclining on cushions as they smoke
their chibouques.</p>

<p>I lodged at the Franciscan Convent, of which the terrace
commands the best view, perhaps, of the city. The young Christian
women of Damascus come hither in numbers to confess, which, if
their tongues be as candid as their eloquent eyes, must be rather a
protracted business. They are passing fair; but the Jewess, with
her aristocratic mien, her proud, yet airy step, and her eagle eye,
throws all others into the shade, and vindicates her lineal descent
from Eve, in this, Eve's native land.</p>

<p>I thought Damascus was a great improvement on Cairo in every
respect. It is much more thoroughly Oriental in appearance, in its
mysteries, in the look and character of its inhabitants. The spirit
of the Arabian Nights is quite alive in these, its native streets;
and not only do you hear their fantastic tales repeated to rapt
audiences in the coffee-houses, but you see them hourly exemplified
in living scenes. This is probably the most ancient city in the
world. Eleazar, the trusty steward of Abraham, was a citizen of it
nearly 4,000 years ago, and the Arabs maintain that Adam was
created here out of the red clay that is now fashioned by the
potter into other forms.</p>

<p>The Christians for the most part belong to the Latin Church.
There are some Greeks, and a few Armenians. The Christians are as
fanatical and grossly ignorant as the Moslems; at least, those few,
even of the wealthier class, with whom I had the opportunity of
conversing.</p>

<h4>CHARLES WATERTON</h4>

<h4>Wanderings in South America</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;First Journey</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Charles Waterton, who was born on June 3, 1782, and who died on
May 27, 1865, was a native of Yorkshire, England. Brought up in a
family loving country life and field sports, he early learned to
cultivate the study of natural history. Speaking of himself in
after life he said, "I cannot boast of any great strength of arm,
but my legs, probably by much walking, and by frequently ascending
trees, have acquired vast muscular power; so that, on taking a view
of me from top to toe, you would say that the 'upper part of
Tithonus has been placed on the lower part of Ajax.'" Educated at
Tudhoe Catholic School, Waterton became a sound Latin scholar. He
proceeded to the Jesuit College at Stonyhurst, where his tutors as
far as possible encouraged his love for natural history, at the
same time stimulating his taste for literature. Fox-hunting was his
delight and he became a famous rider. His parents wished him to see
the world, and his travels began with a tour in Spain, visiting
London on the way back to Yorkshire and there making the
acquaintance of Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society
and scientific M&aelig;cenas of his age. In 1804 he sailed for
Demerara, there to administer the estates of his paternal uncle,
and, liking the country, managed that business till 1812, coming
home at intervals. Subsequently, Waterton undertook arduous and
adventurous journeys in Guiana, simply as a naturalist. His
accounts of his experiences made him famous. He also travelled in
the United States and the Antilles, then in Holland, Belgium,
Switzerland, Italy, and Sicily. Besides his "Wanderings in South
America" he wrote an attractive volume entitled "Natural History:
Essays."</p>
</div>

<p>In the month of April, 1812, I left the town of Stabroek, to
travel through the wilds of Demerara and Essequibo, a part of
<i>ci-devant</i> Dutch Guiana, in South America. The chief objects
in view were to collect a quantity of the strongest Wourali poison,
and to reach the inland frontier fort of Portuguese Guiana.</p>

<p>It would be a tedious journey for him who wishes to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
proceed through those wilds, to set out from Stabroek on foot. The
sun would exhaust him in his attempts to wade through the swamps,
and the mosquitoes at night would deprive him of every hour of
sleep. The road for horses runs parallel to the river, but it
extends a very little way, and even ends before the cultivation of
the plantation ceases.</p>

<p>The only mode then that remains is to travel by water; and when
you come to the high lands, you make your way through the forest on
foot, or continue your route on the river. After passing the third
island in the river Demerara, there are few plantations to be seen,
and those are not joining on to one another, but separated by large
tracts of wood. The first rocks of any considerable size are at a
place called Saba, from the Indian word which means a stone. Near
the top of Saba stands the house of the postholder, appointed by
government to report to the protector of the Indians, of what is
going on among them; and to prevent suspicious people from passing
up the river.</p>

<p>When the Indians assemble here, the stranger may have an
opportunity of seeing the aborigines, dancing to the sound of their
country music, and painted in their native style. They will shoot
their arrows for him with unerring aim and send the poisoned dart,
from the blowpipe, true to its destination.</p>

<p>This is the native country of the sloth. His looks, his
gestures, his cries, all conspire to entreat you to take pity on
him. These are the only weapons of defence nature has given him. It
is said his piteous moans make the tiger cat relent and turn out of
his way. Do not then level your gun at him, or pierce him with a
poisoned arrow;&mdash;he has never hurt one living creature. A few
leaves, and those of the commonest and coarsest kind, are all he
asks for his support.</p>

<p>Demerara yields to no country in the world in her wonderful and
beautiful productions of the feathered<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span> race. The scarlet
curlew breeds in innumerable quantities in the muddy islands on the
coasts of Pomauron; the egrets in the same place. They resort to
the mudflats in ebbing water, while thousands of sandpipers and
plovers, with here and there a spoonbill and flamingo, are seen
among them. The pelicans go farther out to sea, but return at
sundown to the courada-trees.</p>

<p>You never fail to see the common vulture where there is carrion.
At the close of day the vampires leave the hollow trees, whither
they had fled at morning's dawn, and scour along the river's banks
in quest of prey. On waking from sleep, the astonished traveller
finds his hammock all stained with blood. It is the vampire that
has sucked him.</p>

<p>What an immense range of forest is there from the rock Saba to
the great fall, and what an uninterrupted extent from it to the
banks of the Essequibo! It will be two days and a half from the
time of entering the path on the western bank of the Demerara till
all be ready, and the canoe fairly afloat on the Essequibo. The new
rigging in it, and putting everything to rights and in its proper
place, cannot well be done in less than a day.</p>

<p>After being night and day in the forest impervious to the sun
and moon's rays, the sudden transition to light has a fine
heart-cheering effect. In coming out of the woods you see the
western bank of the Essequibo before you, low and flat. Proceeding
onwards past many islands which enliven the scene, you get to the
falls and rapids. When the river is swollen, as it was in May,
1812, it is a dangerous task to pass them.</p>

<p>A little before you pass the last of the rapids two immense
rocks appear, which look like two ancient stately towers of some
Gothic potentate, rearing their heads above the surrounding trees.
From their situation and their shape, they strike the beholder with
an idea of antiquated grandeur, which he will never forget. He may
travel far and wide and see nothing like them. The<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Indians have it that they are the abode of an evil genius, and they
pass in the river below, with a reverential awe.</p>

<p>In about seven hours, from these stupendous sons of the hill you
leave the Essequibo and enter the river Apoura-poura, which falls
into it from the south. Two days afterwards you are within the
borders of Macoushia, inhabited by the Macoushi Indians, who are
uncommonly dexterous in the use of the blowpipe and famous for
their skill in preparing the deadly vegetable poison called
Wourali, to which I alluded at the outset of this narration.</p>

<p>From this country are procured those beautiful paroquets named
Kessikessi. Here too is found the india-rubber tree. The elegant
crested bird called Cock of the Rock is a native of the wooded
mountains of Macoushia. The Indians in this district seem to depend
more on the Wourali poison for killing their game than on anything
else. They had only one gun, and it appeared rusty and neglected;
but their poisoned weapons were in fine order. Their blowpipes hung
from the roof of the hut, carefully suspended by a silk grass cord.
The quivers were close by them, with the jawbone of the fish Pirai
tied by a string to their brim, and a small wicker-basket of wild
cotton, which hung down the centre; they were nearly full of
poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>On the fifth day our canoe reached the fort on the Portuguese
inland frontier. I had by this time contracted a feverish attack.
The Portuguese commandant, who came to greet us, discovered that I
was sick. "I am sorry, sir," said he, "to see that the fever has
taken such hold of you. You shall go with me to the fort; and
though we have no doctor there, I trust we shall soon bring you
about again. The orders I have received, forbidding the admission
of strangers, were never intended to be put in force against a sick
English gentleman."</p>

<p>Good nourishment and rest, and the unwearied attention and
kindness of the Portuguese commander, stopped<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span> the
progress of the fever, and enabled me to walk about in six days.
Having reached this frontier, and collected a sufficient quantity
of the Wourali poison, nothing remains but to give a brief account
of its composition, its effects, its uses, and its supposed
antidotes.</p>

<p>Much has been said concerning this fatal and extraordinary
poison. Wishful to obtain the best information, I determined to
penetrate into the country where the poisonous ingredients grow.
Success attended the adventure, and this made amends for the 120
days passed in the solitudes of Guiana. It is certain that if a
sufficient quantity of the poison enters the blood, death is the
result; but there is no alteration in the colour of the blood, and
both the blood and the flesh may be eaten with safety.</p>

<p>This poison destroys life so gently that the victim seems to be
in no pain whatever. The Indian finds in the wilds a vine called
Wourali, which furnishes the chief ingredient. He also adds the
juices of a bitter root and of two bulbous plants. Next he hunts
till he finds two species of ants, one very large, black, and
venomous; the other small and red, which stings like a nettle. He
adds the pounded fangs of the Labarri and the Counacouchi snakes;
and the last ingredient is red pepper.</p>

<p>The mixture is boiled and looks like coffee. It is poured into a
calabash. Let us now note how it is used. When the Indian goes in
quest of game, he seldom carries his bow and arrows. It is the
blowpipe he then uses. This is a most extraordinary instrument of
death. The reed must grow to an amazing length, as the part used is
ten feet long. This is placed inside a larger tube. The arrow is
from nine to ten inches long. It is made out of leaf of a species
of palm-tree, and about an inch of the pointed end is poisoned. The
other end is fixed into a lump of wild cotton made skilfully to fit
the tube.</p>

<p>Chiefly birds are shot with this weapon. The flesh<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span> of
the game is not in the least injured by the poison. For larger game
bows are used with poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>An Arowack Indian said it was but four years ago that he and his
companions were ranging in the forest for game. His companion took
a poisoned arrow and sent it at a red monkey in a tree above him.
It was nearly a perpendicular shot. The arrow missed the monkey,
and, in the descent, struck him in the arm. He was convinced it was
all over with him. "I shall never bend this bow again," said he.
And having said that, he took off his little bamboo poison box,
which hung across his shoulder, and putting it with his bow and
arrow on the ground, he laid himself close by them, bid his
companion farewell, and never spoke more.</p>

<p>Sugar-cane and salt are supposed to be antidotes, but in reality
they are of no avail. He who is unfortunate enough to be wounded by
a poisoned arrow from Macoushia will find them of no avail. He has
got a deadly foe within him which will allow him but very little
time. In a few moments he will be numbered with the dead.</p>

<div class="center"><i>II.&mdash;Second Journey</i></div>

<p>In the year 1816, two days before the vernal equinox, I sailed
from Liverpool for Pernambuco, in the southern hemisphere, on the
coast of Brazil. Arrived there, I embarked on board of a Portuguese
brig for Cayenne in Guiana. On the 14th day after leaving
Pernambuco, the brig cast anchor off the island of Cayenne. The
entrance is beautiful. To windward, not far off, are two bold
wooded islands, called Father and Mother; and near them are others,
their children, smaller, though beautiful as their parents.</p>

<p>All along the coast are seen innumerable quantities of
snow-white egrets, scarlet curlews, spoonbills, and flamingoes.
About a day's journey in the interior is the<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
celebrated national plantation called La Gabrielle, with which no
other plantation in the western world can vie. In it are 22,000
clove-trees in full bearing. The black pepper, the cinnamon, and
the nutmeg are also in great abundance here.</p>

<p>Not far from the banks of the river Oyapoc, to windward of
Cayenne, is a mountain which contains an immense cavern. Here the
Cock of the Rock is plentiful. He is about the size of a fantail
pigeon, his colour a bright orange and his wings and tail appear as
though fringed; his head is adorned with a superb double-feathery
crest, edged with purple.</p>

<p>Finding that a beat to the Amazons would be long and tedious,
and aware that the season for procuring birds in fine plumage had
already set in, I left Cayenne for Paramaribo, went through the
interior to Coryntin, stopped a few days in New Amsterdam, and
proceeded to Demerara.</p>

<p>Though least in size, the glittering mantle of the humming-bird
entitles it to the first place in the list of the birds of the New
World. See it darting through the air almost as quick as thought.
Now it is within a yard of your face, and then is in an instant
gone. Now it flutters from flower to flower. Now it is a ruby, now
a topaz, now an emerald, now all burnished gold.</p>

<p>Cayenne and Demerara produce the same humming-birds. On entering
the forests the blue and green, the smallest brown, no bigger than
the humble bee, with two long feathers in the tail, and the little
forked-tail purple-throated humming-birds glitter before you in
ever-changing attitudes.</p>

<p>There are three species of toucans in Dememara, and three
diminutives, which may be called toucanets. The singular form of
these birds makes a lasting impression on the memory. Every species
of this family of enormous bill lays its eggs in the hollow trees.
You will be at a loss to know for what ends nature has
overloaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id=
"Page_320">320</a></span> the head of this bird with such an
enormous bill. It is impossible to conjecture.</p>

<p>You would not be long in the forests of Demerara without
noticing the woodpeckers. The sound which the largest kind makes in
hammering against the bark of the tree is so loud that you would
never suppose it to proceed from the efforts of a bird. You would
take it to be the woodman, with his axe, striking a sturdy blow,
oft repeated. There are fourteen species here, all beautiful, and
the greater part of them have their heads ornamented with a fine
crest, movable at pleasure.</p>

<p>In the rivers, and different creeks, you number six species of
the kingfisher. They make their nest in a hole in the sand on the
side of the bank. Wherever there is a wild fig-tree ripe, a
numerous species of birds, called Tangara, is sure to be on it.
There are 18 beautiful species here. Their plumage is very rich and
diversified; some of them boast six different colours.</p>

<p>Parrots and paroquets are very numerous here, and of many
different kinds. The hia-hia parrot, called in England the parrot
of the sun, is very remarkable. He can erect at pleasure a fine
radiated circle of tartan feathers quite around the back of his
head from jaw to jaw. Superior in size and beauty to every parrot
of South America, the ara will force you to take your eyes from the
rest of animated nature and gaze at him. His commanding strength,
the flaming scarlet of his body, the lovely variety of red, yellow,
blue, and green in his wings, the extraordinary length of his blue
and scarlet tail, seem all to join and demand for him the title of
emperor of all the parrots.</p>

<p>There are nine species of the goatsucker in Demerara, a bird
with prettily mottled plumage like that of the owl. Its cry is so
remarkable that, once heard it can never be forgotten. When night
reigns over these wilds you will hear this goatsucker lamenting
like one in deep distress. A stranger would never conceive the cry
to be that of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id=
"Page_321">321</a></span> bird. He would say it was the
departing voice of a midnight murdered victim, or the last wailing
of Niobe for her poor children, before she was turned into
stone.</p>

<p>Suppose yourself in hopeless sorrow, begin with a high loud
note, and pronounce "ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha," each note lower
and lower, till the last is scarcely heard, pausing a moment or two
betwixt every note, and you will have some idea of the moaning of
the goatsucker of Demerara. You will never persuade the native to
let fly his arrow at these birds. They are creatures of omen and of
reverential dread. They are the receptacles of departed souls come
back to earth, unable to rest for crimes done in their days of
nature.</p>

<div class="center"><i>III.&mdash;Third Journey</i></div>

<p>Gentle reader, after staying a few months in England, I strayed
across the Alps and the Apennines, and returned home, but could not
tarry. Guiana still whispered in my ear, and seemed to invite me
once more to wander through her distant forests. In February, 1820,
I sailed from the Clyde, on board the Glenbervie, a fine West
Indiaman.</p>

<p>Sad and mournful was the story we heard on entering the river
Demerara. The yellow fever had swept off numbers of the old
inhabitants, and the mortal remains of many a new comer were daily
passing down the streets, in slow and mute procession.</p>

<p>I myself was soon attacked severely by the fever, but was
fortunate enough to recover after much suffering. Next I was
wounded painfully in the foot by treading on a hard stump, while
pursuing a red woodpecker in the depths of the forest. The wound
healed in about three weeks, and I again joyfully sallied
forth.</p>

<p>Let us now turn attention to the sloth, whose haunts have
hitherto been so little known. He is a scarce and solitary animal,
living in trees, and being good food, is<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span> never allowed to
escape. He inhabits remote and gloomy forests, where snakes take up
their abode, and where cruelly stinging ants and scorpions, and
swamps, and innumerable thorny shrubs and bushes obstruct the steps
of civilized man. We are now in the sloth's own domain.</p>

<p>Some years ago I kept a sloth in my room for several months. I
often took him out of the house and placed him on the ground. If
the ground were rough, he would pull himself forward, by means of
his forelegs, at a pretty good pace. He invariably shaped his
course at once towards the nearest tree. But if I put him on a
smooth and well-trodden part of the road, he appeared to be in
trouble and distress. His favourite abode was the back of a chair,
and after getting all his legs in a line on the topmost part of it,
he would hang there for hours together, and often with a low and
inward cry, would seem to invite me to take notice of him.</p>

<p>We will now take a view of the vampire. As there was a free
entrance and exit to the vampire, in the loft where I slept, I had
many fine opportunities of paying attention to this nocturnal
surgeon. He does not always live on blood. When the moon shone
brightly, and the bananas were ripe, I could see him approach and
eat them. The vampire measures about 26 inches from wing to wing
extended. He frequents old abandoned houses and hollow trees, and
sometimes a cluster of them may be seen in the forest hanging head
downward from the branch of a tree.</p>

<p>Some years ago I went to the river Paumaron with a Scotch
gentleman, by name Tarbet. Next morning I heard him muttering in
his hammock, and now and then letting fall an imprecation or two,
just about the time he ought to have been saying his morning
prayers. "What is the matter, sir," I said, softly; "is anything
amiss?" "What's the matter?" answered he surlily; "why, the
vampires have been sucking me to death."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>As soon as there was light enough. I went to his hammock, and
saw it much stained with blood. "There, see how these infernal imps
have been drawing my life's blood," said he, thrusting a foot out
of the hammock. The vampire had tapped his great toe; there was a
wound somewhat less than that made by a leech; the blood was still
oozing from it. I conjectured he might have lost from ten to twelve
ounces of blood.</p>

<p>I had often wished to have been once sucked by the vampire, in
order that I might have it in my power to say it had really
happened to me. There can be no pain in the operation, for the
patient is always asleep when the vampire is sucking him; and as
for the loss of a few ounces of blood, that would be a trifle in
the long run. Many a night have I slept with my foot out of the
hammock to tempt this winged surgeon, expecting that he would be
there; but it was all in vain; the vampire never sucked me, and I
could never account for his not doing so, for we were inhabitants
of the same loft for months together.</p>

<p>Let us now forget for awhile the quadrupeds and other animals,
and take a glance at the native Indians of these forests. There are
five principal tribes in Demerara, commonly known by the name of
Warow, Arowack, Acoway, Carib, and Macoushi. They live in small
hamlets consisting never of more than twelve huts. These huts are
always in the forest near a river. They are open on all sides
(except those of the Macoushi) and covered with a species of
palm-leaf.</p>

<p>Both men and women are unclothed. They are a very clean people,
and wash in the river at least twice a day. They have very few
diseases. I never saw an idiot among their number. Their women
never perish at childbirth, owing no doubt to their never wearing
stays. They are very jealous of their liberty, and much attached to
their own mode of living. Some Indians who have accompanied white
men to Europe, on returning to their<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span> own land, have thrown
off their clothes, and gone back into the forests.</p>

<p>Let us now return to natural history. One morning I killed a
Coulacanara, a snake 14 feet long, large enough to have crushed any
one of us to death. After skinning it I could easily get my head
into his mouth, as its jaws admit of wonderful extension. A Dutch
friend of mine killed a boa 22 feet long, with a pair of stag's
horns in his mouth. He had swallowed the stag but could not get the
horns down. In this plight the Dutchman found him as he was going
in his canoe up the river, and sent a ball through his head.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning a negro informed me that he had discovered a
great snake in a large tree which had been upset by a whirlwind and
was lying decaying on the ground. I had been in search of a large
serpent for a long time. I told two negroes to follow me while I
led the way with a cutlass in my hand. Taking as an additional
weapon a long lance, I carried this perpendicularly before me, with
the point about a foot from the ground. The snake had not moved,
and on getting up to him, I struck him with the lance just behind
the neck, and pinned him to the ground. That moment the negro next
to me seized the lance and held it fast in its place, while I
dashed up to grapple with the serpent, and to get hold of his tail
before he could do any mischief.</p>

<p>The snake on being pinned gave a tremendous hiss. We had a sharp
fray, rotten sticks flying on all sides, and each party struggling
for superiority. I called to the second negro to throw himself on
me, as I found I was not heavy enough. He did so and the additional
weight was of great service. I had now got firm hold of his tail,
and after a violent struggle or two, he gave in. So I contrived to
unloose my braces and with them tied up the snake's mouth.</p>

<p>The serpent now tried to better himself and set resolutely to
work, but we overpowered him. We contrived<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span> to make him twist
himself round the shaft of the lance, and then prepared to convey
him out of the forest. I stood at his head and held it firm under
my arm, one negro supported the belly, and the other the tail. In
this order we slowly moved towards home, resting ten times. The
snake vainly fought hard for freedom. At my abode I cut his throat.
He bled like an ox. By next evening he was completely
dissected.</p>

<p>When I had done with the carcase of the great snake it was
conveyed into the forest, as I expected it would attract the king
of the vultures, as soon as time should have rendered it
sufficiently savoury. In a few days it sent forth that odour which
a carcase should, and about twenty of the common vultures came and
perched on the neighbouring trees. The king of the vultures came
too; and I observed that none of the common ones inclined to begin
breakfast till his majesty had finished. When he had consumed as
much snake as nature informed him would do him good, he retired to
the top of a high mora-tree, and then all the common vultures fell
to and made a hearty meal.</p>

<p>When canoeing down the noble river Essequibo I had an adventure
with a cayman, which we caught with a shark hook baited with the
flesh of the acouri. The cayman was ten and a half feet long. He
had swallowed the bait in the night and was thus fast to the end of
a rope. My people pulled him up from the depths and out he
came&mdash;"<i>monstrum horrendum, informe</i>." I saw that he was
in a state of fear and perturbation. I jumped on his back,
immediately seized his forelegs, and by main force twisted them on
his back; thus they served for a bridle.</p>

<p>The cayman now seemed to have recovered from his surprise and
plunged furiously, and lashed the sand with his long tail. I was
out of reach of the strokes of it, by being near his head. He
continued to plunge and strike, and made my seat very
uncomfortable. It must have been a fine sight for an unoccupied
spectator. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id=
"Page_326">326</a></span> people roared in triumph and pulled
us above forty yards on the sand. It was the first time I was ever
on a cayman's back. Should it be asked how I managed to keep my
seat, I would answer that I hunted for some years with Lord
Darlington's foxhounds.</p>

<p>After some further struggling the cayman gave in. I now managed
to tie up his jaws. He was finally conveyed to the canoe and then
to the place where we had suspended our hammocks. There I cut his
throat and after breakfast commenced the dissection.</p>

<h4>ARTHUR YOUNG</h4>

<h4>Travels in France</h4>

<div class="center"><i>I.&mdash;The First Journey, 1787</i></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Arthur Young was born September 11, 1741, at Whitehall; died
April 20, 1820. Most of his life was spent on his patrimonial
estate at Bradfield Hall, near Bury St. Edmunds, England. He was
the son of the Rev. Dr. Arthur Young, rector of Bradfield,
Prebendary of Canterbury Cathedral, and Chaplain to Arthur Onslow,
Speaker of the House of Commons. On his father's death he took to
farming, but at the same time addicted himself to literature,
becoming a parliamentary reporter. Arthur Young was indeed much
more successful in literary pursuits than in the practice of
husbandry. His book entitled "A Tour Through the Southern Counties
of England" achieved great popularity. This he actively followed by
writing other works describing agricultural conditions in various
parts of England, and in Ireland. His vivid and interesting style
secured for his treatises a very wide circulation. In 1784 he
commenced the issue of an annual register entitled "The Annals of
Agriculture" of which 45 volumes were published. Three years later
an invitation from the Comte de la Rochefoucauld induced Young to
visit France. He went a second and a third time, and created a
sensation by the publication of an account of his experiences
during the three consecutive years that immediately preceded the
Revolution. Arthur Young travelled on horseback through many
districts of France in the midst of the disturbances. So realistic
is his account that it is regarded as the most reliable record ever
written of the French rural conditions of that period. The French
Directory ordered all Young's works to be translated into French,
and they are as popular as ever to-day across the Channel.</p>
</div>

<p>There are two methods of writing travels; to register the
journey itself, or the result of it. In the former case it is a
diary; the latter usually falls into the shape of essays on
distinct subjects. A journal form has the advantage of carrying
with a greater degree of credibility; and, of course, more weight.
A traveller who thus registers his observations is detected the
moment he writes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id=
"Page_328">328</a></span> things he has not seen. If he sees
little, he must register little. The reader is saved from
imposition. On the other hand a diary necessarily leads to
repetitions on the same subjects and the same ideas.</p>

<p>In favour of composing essays there is the counterbalancing
advantage that the matter comes with the full effect of force and
completeness from the author. Another admirable circumstance is
brevity, by the rejection of all useless details. After weighing
the <i>pour</i> and the <i>contre</i>, I think it not impracticable
to retain in my case the benefit of both plans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Journal</span>. May 15. The strait that
separates England, fortunately for her, from the rest of the world,
must be crossed many times before the traveller ceases to be
surprised at the sudden and universal change that surrounds him on
landing at Calais. The scene, the people, the language, every
object is new. The noble improvement of a salt marsh by Mons.
Mourons of this town, occasioned my acquaintance some time ago with
that gentleman. I spent an agreeable and instructive evening at his
house.</p>

<p>May 17. Nine hours rolling at anchor had so fatigued my mare,
that I thought it necessary to rest her one day; but this morning I
left Calais. For a few miles the country resembles parts of Norfolk
and Suffolk. The aspect is the same on to Boulogne. Towards that
town I was pleased to find many seats belonging to people who
reside there. How often are false ideas conceived from reading and
report. I imagined that nobody but farmers and labourers in France
lived in the country; and the first ride I take in that kingdom
shows me a score of country seats. The road is excellent.</p>

<p>May 18. Boulogne is not an ugly town, and from the ramparts of
the upper part the view is beautiful. Many persons from England
reside here, their misfortunes in trade or extravagance in living
making their sojourn abroad more agreeable than at home.</p>

<p><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">
329</a></span>The country around improves. It is more inclosed. There are some
fine meadows about Bonbrie, and several chateaux. I am not
professedly on husbandry in this diary, but must just observe, that
it is to the full as bad as the country is good; corn miserable and
yellow with weeds, yet all summer fallowed with lost attention.</p>

<p>May 22. Poverty and poor crops at Amiens. Women are now
ploughing with a pair of horses to sow barley. The difference of
the customs of the two nations is in nothing more striking than in
the labours of the sex; in England it is very little they will do
in the fields except to glean and make hay; the first is a party of
pilfering, and the second of pleasure; in France they plough and
fill the dung-cart.</p>

<p>May 25. The environs of Clermont are picturesque. The hills
about Liancourt are pretty and spread with a kind of cultivation I
have never seen before, a mixture of vineyards (for here the vines
first appear), gardens and corn. A piece of wheat, a scrap of
lucorne, a patch of clover or vetches, a bit of vine with cherry
and other fruit trees scattered among all, and the whole cultivated
with the spade; it makes a pretty appearance, but must form a poor
system of trifling.</p>

<p>The forest around Chantilly, belonging to the Prince of
Cond&eacute;, is immense, spreading far and wide. They say the
capitainerie, or paramountship, is above 100 miles in
circumference. That is to say, all the inhabitants for that extent
are pestered with game, without permission to destroy it, for one
man's diversion. Ought not these capitaineries to be
extirpated?</p>

<p>May 27. At Versailles. After breakfasting with Count de la
Rochefoucauld at his apartments in the palace, where he is grand
master of the wardrobe, was introduced by him to the Duke de la
Rochefoucauld. As the duke is going to Luchon in the Pyrenees, I am
to have the honour of being one of the party. The ceremony of the
day was the king's investing the Duke of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span> Berri with the
<i>cordon bleu</i>. The queen's band was in the chapel during the
function, but the musical effect was thin and weak. During the
service the king was seated between his two brothers, and seemed by
his carriage and inattention to wish himself a hunting. The queen
is the most beautiful woman I saw to-day.</p>

<p>May 30. At Orleans. The country around is one universal flat,
unenclosed, uninteresting, and even tedious, but the prospect from
the steeple of the fine cathedral is commanding, extending over an
unbounded plain, through which the magnificent Loire bends his
stately way, in sight for 14 leagues.</p>

<p>May 31. On leaving Orleans, enter the miserable province of
Sologne. The poor people who cultivate the soil here are
m&eacute;tayers, that is, men who hire the land without ability to
stock it; the proprietor is forced to provide seed and cattle, and
he and his tenant divide the produce; a miserable system that
perpetuates poverty and prevents instruction. The same wretched
country continues to La Loge; the fields are scenes of pitiable
management, as the houses are full of misery. Heaven grant me
patience while I see a country thus neglected, and forgive me the
oaths I swear at the absence and ignorance of the possessors.</p>

<p>June 11. See for the first time the Pyrenees, at the distance of
150 miles. Towards Cahors the country changes and has something of
a savage aspect, yet houses are seen everywhere, and one-third of
it under vines. The town is bad; its chief trade and resource are
wines and brandies.</p>

<p>June 14. Reach Toulouse, which is a very large and very ancient
city, but not peopled in proportion to its size. It has had a
university since 1215 and has always prided itself on its taste for
literature and art. The noble quay is of great length.</p>

<p>June 16. A ridge of hills on the other side of the Garonne,
which began at Toulouse, became more and<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span> more regular
yesterday; and is undoubtedly the most distant ramification of the
Pyrenees, reaching into this vast vale quite to Toulouse, but no
farther. Approach the mountains; the lower ones are all cultivated,
but the higher ones seem covered with wood. Meet many wagons, each
loaded with two casks of wine, quite backward in the carriage, and
as the hind wheels are much higher than the lower ones, it shows
that these mountaineers have more sense than John Bull.</p>

<p>The wheels of these wagons are all shod with wood instead of
iron. Here for the first time, see rows of maples, with vines
trained in festoons from tree to tree; they are conducted by a rope
of bramble, vine cutting, or willow. They give many grapes, but bad
wine. Pass St. Martino, and then a large village of well built
houses, without a single glass window.</p>

<p>June 17. St. Gaudens is an improving town, with many new houses,
something more than comfortable. An uncommon view of St. Bertrand.
You break at once upon a vale sunk deep enough beneath the point of
view to command every hedge and tree, with that town clustered
round its large cathedral, on a rising ground. The mountains rise
proudly around, and give their rough frame to this exquisite little
picture. Immense quantities of poultry in all this country; most of
it the people salt and keep in grease.</p>

<p>Quit the Garonne some leagues before Serpe, where the river
Neste falls into it. The road to Bagn&eacute;re is along this
river, in a narrow valley, at one end of which is built the town of
Luchon, the termination of our journey; which has to me been one of
the most agreeable I ever undertook. Having now crossed the
kingdom, and been in many French inns, I shall in general observe,
that they are on an average better in two respects, and worse in
all the rest, than those in England. We have lived better in point
of eating and drinking beyond a question, than we should have done
in going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">
332</a></span> from London to the Highlands of Scotland, at double
the expense.</p>

<p>The common cookery of the French gives great advantage. It is
true they roast everything to a chip if they are not cautioned, but
they give such a number and variety of dishes, that if you do not
like some, there are others to please your palate. The dessert at a
French inn has no rival at an English one. But you have no parlour
to eat in; only a room with two, three, or four beds. Apartments
badly fitted up; the walls whitewashed; or paper of different sorts
in the same room; or tapestry so old as to be a fit <i>nidus</i>
for moths and spiders; and the furniture such, that an English
innkeeper would light his fire with it.</p>

<p>For a table you have everywhere a board laid on cross bars,
which are so conveniently contrived as to leave room for your legs
only at the end. Oak chairs with rush bottoms, and the back
universally perpendicular, defying all idea of rest after fatigue.
Doors give music as well as entrance; the wind whistles through
their chinks; and hinges grate discord. Windows admit rain as well
as light; when shut they are not easy to open; and when open not
easy to shut.</p>

<p>Mops, brooms, and scrubbing brushes are not in the catalogue of
the necessaries of a French inn. Bells there are none; the
<i>fille</i> must always be bawled for; and when she appears, is
neither neat, well dressed, nor handsome. The kitchen is black with
smoke; the master commonly the cook, and the less you see of the
cooking the more likely you are to have a stomach to your dinner.
The mistress rarely classes civility or attention to her guests
among the requisites of her trade. We are so unaccustomed in
England to live in our bed-chambers that it is at first awkward in
France to find that people live nowhere else. Here I find that
everybody, let his rank be what it may, lives in his
bed-chamber.</p>

<p>August 27. Cherbourg. Not a place for a residence longer than is
necessary. I was here fleeced more infamously than at any other
town in France.</p>

<p>Sept. 5. To Montauban. The poor people seem poor indeed; the
children terribly ragged, if possible worse clad than if with no
clothes at all; as to shoes and stockings, they are luxuries. A
beautiful girl of six or seven playing with a stick, and smiling
under such a bundle of rags as made my heart ache to see her.
One-third of this province seems uncultivated, and nearly all of it
in misery. What have kings, and ministers, and parliaments, and
states, to answer for their prejudices, seeing millions of hands
that would be industrious, idle and starving through the execrable
maxims of despotism, or the equally detestable prejudices of a
feudal nobility. Sleep at the "Lion d'Or," at Montauban, an
abominable hole.</p>

<p>The 8th. Enter Bas Bretagne. One recognises at once another
people, meeting numbers who know no French. Enter Guingamp by
gateways, towers, and battlements, apparently the oldest military
architecture; every part denoting antiquity, and in the best
preservation. The habitations of the poor are miserable heaps of
dirt; no glass, and scarcely any light; but they have earth
chimneys.</p>

<p>Sept. 21. Came to an improvement in the midst of sombre country.
Four good houses of stone and slate, and a few acres run to
wretched grass, which have been tilled, but all savage, and become
almost as rough as the rest. I was afterwards informed that this
improvement, as it is called, was wrought by Englishmen, at the
expense of a gentleman they ruined as well as themselves. I
demanded how it had been done? Pare and burn, and sow wheat, then
rye, and then oats. Thus it is for ever and ever! The same follies,
blundering, and ignorance;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334"
id="Page_334">334</a></span> and then all the fools in the
country said as they do now, that these wastes are good for
nothing. To my amazement I find that they reach within three miles
of the great commercial city of Nantes.</p>

<p>The 22nd. At Nantes, a town which has that sign of prosperity of
new buildings that never deceives. The quarter of the
Com&eacute;die is magnificent, all the streets at right angles and
of white stone. Messrs. Epivent had the goodness to attend me in a
water expedition, to view the establishment of Mr. Wilkinson, for
boring cannon, in an island on the Loire, below Nantes. Until that
well-known English manufacturer arrived, the French knew nothing of
the art of casting cannon solid, and then boring them.</p>

<p>Nantes is as <i>enflamm&eacute;</i> in the cause of liberty as
any town in France can be. The conversations I have witnessed here
prove how great a change is effected in the mind of the French, nor
do I believe it will be possible for the present government to last
half a century longer. The American revolution has laid the
foundation of another in France, if government does not take care
of itself. On the 23rd one of the twelve prisoners from the
Bastille arrived here&mdash;he was the most violent of them
all&mdash;and his imprisonment has not silenced him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Author's Note.</span>[&mdash;It wanted no
great spirit of prophecy to foretell this revolution; but later
events have shown that I was very wide of the mark when I talked of
fifty years. The twelve gentlemen of Bretagne deputed to
Versailles, mentioned above, were sent with a denunciation of the
ministers for their suspension of provincial parliaments. They were
at once sent to the Bastille. It was this war of the king and the
parliaments that brought about the assembly of the States General,
the step being decided on by the assembly of Grenoble, July 21,
1788.]</p>

<div class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">
335</a></span><i>III.&mdash;Third Journey, 1789</i></div>

<p>June 5. Passage to Calais; 14 hours for reflection in a vehicle
that does not allow one power to reflect.</p>

<p>The 8th. At Paris, which is at present in such a ferment about
the States General, now holding at Versailles, that conversation is
absolutely absorbed by them. The nobility and clergy demand one
thing, the commons another. The king, court, nobility, clergy,
army, and parliament are nearly in the same situation. All these
consider, with equal dread, the ideas of liberty, now afloat;
except the king, who, for reasons obvious to those who know his
character, troubles himself little, even with circumstances that
concern his character the most intimately.</p>

<p>The 9th. The business going forward at present in the pamphlet
shops of Paris is incredible. Every hour produces something new.
This spirit of reading political tracts spreads into the provinces,
so that all presses of France are equally employed.
Nineteen-twentieths of these productions are in favour of liberty,
and commonly violent against the clergy and nobility. Is it not
wonderful, that while the press teems with the most levelling and
seditious principles, that if put into execution would overturn the
monarchy, nothing in reply appears, and not the least step is taken
by the court to restrain this extreme licentiousness of
publication? It is easy to conceive the spirit that must thus be
raised among the people.</p>

<p>The 10th. Everything conspires to render the present period in
France critical. The want of bread is terrible, and accounts arrive
every moment from the provinces of riots and disturbances, and
calling in the military, to preserve the peace of the markets. It
appears that there would have been no real scarcity if M. Necker
would have let the corn trade alone.</p>

<p>The 15th. This has been a rich day, and such an one<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span> as
ten years ago none could believe would ever arrive in France. Went
to the Hall of States at Versailles, a very important debate being
expected on the condition of the nation. M. l'Abb&eacute;
Siey&egrave;s opened it. He is a violent republican, absolutely
opposed to the present government, which he thinks too bad to be
regulated, and wishes to see overturned. He speaks ungracefully and
uneloquently, but logically.</p>

<p>M. le Comte de Mirabeau replied, speaking without notes for near
an hour in most eloquent style. He opposed with great force the
reasoning of the Abb&eacute;, and was loudly applauded.</p>

<p>The 20th. News! News! Everyone stares at what everyone might
have expected. A message from the king to the presidents of the
three orders, that he should meet them on Monday; and, under
pretence of preparing the hall for the occasion, the French guards
were placed with bayonets to prevent any of the deputies entering
the room. The circumstances of doing this ill-judged act of
violence have been as ill-advised as the act itself.</p>

<p>The 24th. The ferment at Paris is beyond conception. All this
day 10,000 people have been in the Palais Royal. M. Necker's plans
of finance are severely criticised, even by his friends.</p>

<p>The 26th. Every hour that passes seems to give the people fresh
spirit. The meetings at the palais are more numerous and more
violent. Nothing less than a revolution in the government and a
free constitution is talked of by all ranks of people; but the
supine stupidity of the court is without example. The king's offers
of negotiation have been rejected. He changes his mind from day to
day.</p>

<p>The 30th. At Nangis, having come from Paris. Entertained at the
ch&acirc;teau of the Marquis de Guerchy. The perruquier in the town
that dressed me this morning tells me that everybody is determined
to pay no taxes; that the soldiers will never fire on the people;
but if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id=
"Page_337">337</a></span> should, it is better to be shot,
than starved. He gave me a frightful account of the misery of the
people. In the market I saw the wheat sold out under the regulation
of the magistrates, that no person should buy more than two bushels
of wheat at a market, to prevent monopolising. A party of dragoons
had been drawn up before the market-cross to prevent violence.</p>

<p>The 15th. At Nancy. Letters from Paris announce that all is
confusion. The ministry has been removed and M. Necker ordered to
quit France quietly. All to whom I spoke agreed that it was fatal
news and that it would occasion great commotion. I am told on every
hand that everything is to be feared from the people, because bread
is so dear, they are half starved, and consequently ready for
commotion. But they are waiting on Paris, which shows the
importance of great cities in the life of a nation. Without Paris,
I question whether the present revolution, which is fast working in
France, could have had an origin.</p>

<p>The 20th. To Strasburg, through one of the richest scenes of
cultivation in France, though Flanders exceeds it. I arrived there
at a critical moment, for a detachment of troops had brought
interesting news of the revolt in Paris&mdash;the Gardes
Fran&ccedil;oises joining the people; the little dependence on the
rest of the troops; the storming of the Bastille; in a word, of the
absolute overthrow of the old government.</p>

<p>The 21st. I have been witness to scenes curious to a foreigner,
but dreadful to Frenchmen who are considerate. Passing through the
square of the Hotel de Ville, the mob was breaking the windows with
stones, notwithstanding an officer and detachment of horse were
there. Perceiving that the troops would not attack them, except in
words and menaces, the rioters grew more violent, broke the windows
of the Hotel de Ville with stones, attempted to beat in the door
with iron bars, and placed ladders to the windows.</p>

<p><span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>In about a quarter of an hour, which gave time for the assembled
magistrates to escape by a back door, they burst all open, and
entered like a torrent with a universal shout of spectators. From
that minute a shower of casements, sashes, shutters, chairs,
tables, sofas, books, papers, pictures, etc., rained incessantly
from all the windows of the house, which is eighty feet long, and
next followed tiles, skirting boards, banisters, frame-work, and
everything that could be detached from the building. The troops,
both horse and foot, were quiet spectators.</p>

<p>The 30th. At Dijon. At the inn here is a gentleman,
unfortunately a seigneur, with wife, three servants, and infant,
who escaped from their flaming ch&acirc;teau half naked in the
night; all their property lost except the land itself&mdash;and
this family, valued and esteemed by the neighbours, with many
virtues to command the love of the poor, and no oppressions to
provoke their enmity. Such abominable actions must bring the more
detestation to the cause from being unnecessary; the kingdom might
have been settled in a real system of liberty, without the
<i>regeneration</i> of fire and sword, plunder, and bloodshed.</p>

<p>August 19. At Thuytz. At eleven at night, a full hour after I
had been asleep, the commander of a file of citizen militia, with
their muskets, swords, sabres, and pikes entered my chamber,
surrounded my bed, and demanded my passport; I was forced to give
it, and also my papers. They told me I was undoubtedly a
conspirator with the queen, the Comte d'Artois, and the Comte
d'Entragues (who has property here), who had employed me as a
surveyor to measure their fields, in order to double their taxes.
My papers being in English saved me. But I had a narrow escape. It
would have been a delicate situation to have been kept a prisoner
probably in some common gaol, while they sent a courier to Paris at
my expense.</p>
